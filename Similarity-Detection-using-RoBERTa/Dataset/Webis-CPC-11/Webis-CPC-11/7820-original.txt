The Lord Lieutenant's sister, Mrs. Arthur Henniker, who is helping him to do the honours of
the Castle, and whom I had known in London, Mr. Fulke Greville, and I, were wandering round
the curious old-fashioned buildings and courtyards that constitute the domain of Dublin Castle
one bright breezy day in early spring. A military band was playing opposite the principal entrance,
whilst the guard was being mounted in precisely the same manner as at the guard mounting at
St. James's. The scene was brilliant and inspiriting in the extreme. As we passed through an
archway we came somewhat suddenly upon the massive Round Tower, from the top of which floated
the Union Jack, and which dates back to a period not later than that of King John. Close to
the Round Tower, which bears so curious a resemblance to the still more magnificent tower of
the same name at Windsor, is the Chapel Royal. Here we found the guardian, a quaint, and garrulous
and most obliging old person, waiting to show us over the handsome, albeit somewhat gloomy,
building. Very exact and particular was our cicerone in pointing out to us the old fourteenth
century painted windows, the special pews reserved for His Excellency, and the ladies and gentlemen
of the court; the coats of arms belonging to the various Governors of Ireland, extending over
a period of many hundreds of years--all these, I say, he carefully pointed out, drawing especial
attention to one over which, at the moment, a thin ray of golden sunlight was falling, and
which, he informed me, was the coat of arms of the Earl of Rochester--poor Rochester, the gay,
the witty, the wicked, and the repentant.
