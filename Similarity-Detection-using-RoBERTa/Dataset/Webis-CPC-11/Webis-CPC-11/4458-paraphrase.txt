I have  discovered  the  plantings  of some humming-birds full of  little  soft-bodied  arachnids,  and  numerous  other birds feed on them. Stinging ants, like bees and wasps, are  nearly  resembled by a  owner  of other insects;  really,   when  I  discovered  any  bug   supplied  with  exceptional   entails  of  protection  I looked for imitative  types,  and was  not ever   let down  in finding them.

Stinging ants are not only nearly made a replicate in pattern and movements by arachnids but by species of Hemiptera and Coleoptera, and the resemblance is often magnificently close.* (* Amongst the longicorn beetles of Chontales, Mallocera spinicollis, Neoclytus Oesopus, and Diphyrama singularis, Bates, all nearly resemble biting ants when going about on dropped logs.) All over the world wasps are imitated in pattern and movements by other bugs, and in the tropics these mimetic types are endless. In numerous situations the bug imitating is so broadly taken, in the usual pattern of the alignment to which it pertains, from that of the bug imitated, that it is tough to envisage how the first steps in the method of imitation took place. Looking although at the immense kind of bug life in the tropics, and recalling that in early tertiary times almost the entire world was in the identical favourable status as considers warmth (vegetation, as asserted by Heer, expanding to the poles), and should have sustained a huge number of species and genera that were decimated throughout the glacial time span, we should presume that, in that large kind of types, it occasionally appeared that two species belonging to distinct instructions rather resembled each other in pattern or colouration, and that the resemblance was step-by-step expanded, when one species had exceptional entails of defence, by the other being availed the more almost it advanced it in appearance.

It is to be commented that the types imitated have habitually some kind of protection contrary to insectivorous birds or mammals; they are supplied with bites or obnoxious odours or tastes, or are exceedingly swift in flight; excepting where inanimate environment is imitated for concealment. Thus I had an opening of verifying in Brazil that some birds, if not all, decline the Heliconii butterflies, which are nearly resembled by butterflies of other families and by moths.
