His
     Royal Highness dined with me, and, of course, the governor. I can
     tell you a piece of news, which is, that the prince is fully
     determined, and has made me promise him, that he shall be at our
     wedding; and he says he will give you to me. His Royal Highness
     has not yet been in a private house to visit, and is determined
     never to do it except in this instance. You know I will ever
     strive to bear such a character as may render it no discredit to
     any man to take notice of me. There is no action in my whole life
     but what is honourable; and I am the more happy at this time on
     that account; for I would, if possible, or in my power, have no
     man near the prince who can have the smallest impeachment as to
     character; for as an individual, I love him, as a prince, I
     honour and revere him. My telling you this history is as to
     myself; my thoughts on all subjects are open to you. We shall
     certainly go to Barbadoes from this island, and when I shall see
     you is not possible for me to guess, so much for marrying a
     sailor. Give my love to
     Josiah. Heaven bless and return you safe to your most
     affectionate

                          "Horatio Nelson."

The attachment here professed for the prince seems to have been caused not less by the loyalty
of Nelson's nature than by the real good qualities of the sailor king. It is probable he tried
to form himself (professionally) on the model of his young commodore, and a better original
it was impossible for him to study. A certain young lieutenant, of the name of Schomberg, conceiving
that he was injuriously treated in an order of the day, issued by his Royal Highness on board
the Pegasus, applied to Nelson for a court-martial to enquire into the charge alleged against
him.
