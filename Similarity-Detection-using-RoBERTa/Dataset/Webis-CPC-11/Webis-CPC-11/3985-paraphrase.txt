Pharoah asked: "Won't he wake up again? If two people pray together will love turn down their prayer?" 

"Maybe," she stated. "If two people prayed together, because if they prayed he would've heard already!" 

Pharoah was stirred emotionally by pity and sorrow. He turned to Meriamun and asked: "once you did win my Crown at the Pieces, will you play me for your love?" 

She was thinking about it. After a few minutes she replied: "Yes I will play you, though I've lost my sly ways. It may be that Meriamun loses again, she's lost everything already. Let me see the Pieces and bring some wine." 

After setting the Pieces she crossed the room. When she tried to offer it to Pharoah he was so intent on the game he didn't drink. 

They began to play the game. He started, then she. It went on like this in the Queen's chambers, which were dark and fragrant. Her eyes shone in the night. The game went on until Pharoah won and swept the board. 

Screaming "Pharoah is dead!" he drank the poisoned cup of wind. 

"Pharoah is dead," said Meriamun, looking deeply into his eyes. 

Realizing he'd seen that look before in Meriamun's eyes, when she'd killed Hataska- Pharoah asked: "What is that look in your eyes?" He grew white as a ghost when he realized the truth. 

Meriamum shouted out "Pharoah is dead!" like a womean wailing at a funeral. "The great Pharoah is dead! Before a man can count to a hundred the days are numbered. Odd. But tomorrow, Meneptah will sit where Hataska sat dead at the knees of Death itself ,like an Osirin in the lap of Osiris. 

Die Pharoah Die! But while you die, listen to me. There is someone I love. The wandererer who leads your hosts. I stole his love via my own witchcraft. He knew I stole his love and would've shamed me- so I falsely accused him publically. But he will come again- and as surely as you are sitting on the knees of Osiris, as surely he'll sit on your throne, Pharoah."
