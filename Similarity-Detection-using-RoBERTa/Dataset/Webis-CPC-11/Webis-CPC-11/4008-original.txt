MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.

NO. XVI.--GERMFOOD.

(BY MARY MORALLY, AUTHOR OF "GINBITTERS!" "ARDART," &C., &C.)

    [The MS. of this remarkable novel was tied round with scarlet
    ribbons, and arrived in a case which had been once used for
    the packing of bottles of rum, or some other potent spirit.
    It is dedicated in highly uncomplimentary terms to "Messieurs
    les Marronneurs glac√©s de Paris." With it came a most
    extraordinary letter, from which we make, without permission,
    the following startling extracts. "Ha! Ha! likewise Fe Fo
    Fum. I smell blood, galloping, panting, whirling, hurling,
    throbbing, maddened blood. My brain is on fire, my pen is a
    flash of lightning. I see stars, three stars, that is to say,
    one of the best brands plucked from the burning. I'm going
    to make your flesh creep. I'll give you fits, paralytic fits,
    epileptic fits, and fits of hysteria, all at the same time.
    Have I ever been in Paris? Never. Do I know the taste of
    absinthe? How dare you ask me such a question? Am I a woman?
    Ask me another. Ugh! it's coming, the demon is upon me. I must
    write three murderous volumes. I must, I must! What was that
    shriek? and that? and that? Unhand me, snakes! Oh!!!!--M.M."]

CHAPTER I.

I was asleep and dreaming--dreaming dreadful, horrible, soul-shattering dreams--dreams that
flung me head-first out of bed, and then flung me back into bed off the uncarpeted floor of
my chamber. But I did not wake--why should I?--it was unnecessary--I wanted to dream--I had
to dream and therefore I dreamt. I was walking home from a cheap restaurant in one of the poorer
quarters of Paris. "Poorer quarters" is a nice vague term. There are many poorer quarters in
a large city. This was one of them. Let that suffice to the critical pedants who clamour for
accuracy and local colour. Accuracy! pah! Shall the soaring soul of a three-volumer be restrained
by the debasing fetters of a grovelling exactitude?
