I have seen him dive from a height
of twenty or thirty feet, and remain under the water till I almost lost my breath wi' anxiety
for his uprising; and then he would have risen at as many yards distant from the place where
he had dived. I recollect o' hearing o' his permitting himsel to be suspended owre a precipice
aboon a hundred feet high, wi' a rope fastened round his oxters, and three laddies like himsel
hauding on by the ither end o't--and this was dune merely to harry the nest o' a waterwagtail.
Had the screams o' the callants, who found him owre heavy for them, and that they were unable
to draw him up again, not brought some ploughmen to their assistance, he must have been precipitated
into eternity. However, as I intended to say, it was shortly after the news arrived o' your
having sailed for India, that a fire broke out in the dead o' nicht in a house occupied by
Katie Alison's father. Never shall I forget the uproar and consternation o' that terrible nicht.
There was not a countenance in the town but was pale wi' terror. The flames roared and raged
from every window, and were visible through some parts in the roof. The great black clouds
o' smoke seemed rushing from the crater of a volcano. The floors o' the second storey were
falling, and crashing, and crackling, and great burning sparks, some o' them as big as a man's
hand, were rising in thousands and tens o' thousands from the flaming ruins, and were driven
by the wind, like a shower o' fire, across the heavens. It was the most fearsome sight I had
ever beheld. But this was not the worst o't; for, at a window in the third storey, which was
the only one in the house from which the flames were not bursting, stood bonny Katie Alison,
wringing her hands and screaming for assistance, while her gowden hair fell upon her shouthers,
and her cries were heard aboon the raging o' the conflagration.
