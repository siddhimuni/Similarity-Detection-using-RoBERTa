The remainder of this
floor of the centre building and the whole of the same floor of the next building south were
taken up by the composing room. A door had been cut in the wall of the building to the north,
just by Mr. Ballantyne's room, through which, and down three steps, was the space devoted to
the editorial and reportorial staff of the Morning News. The front end of this space was partitioned
off into three rooms, 7 x 12 feet each. Field claimed one of these boxes, the dramatic critic
and solitary artist of the establishment one, and Morgan Bates, the exchange editor, and I
were sandwiched in between them. The rest of the floor was given up to the city staff. The
telegraph editor had a space railed off for his accommodation in the composing room. If a fire
had broken out in the central building in those days, along about ten P.M., the subsequent
proceedings of Eugene Field and of others then employed on the Morning News would probably
not have been of further interest, except to the coroner.

Of the three rooms mentioned, Field's was the only one having any pretensions to decoration.
Its floor and portions of the wall were stained and grained a rich brown with the juice of
the tobacco plant. In one corner Field had a cupboard-shaped pigeon-file, alphabetically arranged,
for the clippings he daily made--almost all relating some bit of personal gossip about people
in the public eye. Scattered about the floor were dumb-bells, Indian clubs, and other gymnastic
apparatus which Field never touched and which the janitor had orders not to disturb in their
disorder. Above Field's desk for some time hung a sheet of tin, which he used as a call bell
or to drown the noise of the office boy poking the big globe stove which was the primitive,
but generally effective, way of heating the whole floor in winter.
