It is there that the Volga, Ural, Sir Daria, and Oxus rivers empty short of doing so in the Ocean, but persist in infusing life into the swiftly desiccating Transcaspian Steppes, or link by way of their tributary system (as does the Volga) the farthest flung areas of European Russia.

These characteristics of the physical topography of the Empire illustrate the relative homogeneity of this extensive region, as well as the diversity of physical attributes on the peripheries.

These also explicate the dispatch with which the growth of Sclavonic settlement has occurred in these sparsely populated areas; and they also shine a light onto the internal steadfastness of the Empire, which surely impresses a sojourner as he traverses this sprawling expanse, and discovers in all regions the identical dominant race and comparable qualities of life.

As a matter of fact, as they make their way from the basins of the Volkhoff and Dnieper to the bases of the Altai and Sayan mountain ranges, to be sure an area amounting to close to one-fourth the circumference of the Earth, the Russian colonists may never encounter noticeably variant physical conditions, but instead, the identical forest and prairies that they knew in their former homelands, the same accommodations for farming, with only slight changes in the topography. Climate and soil previously unknown, and the resulting divergent cultures and civilizations, the Russian migrants encountered, in their expansion southeastward, though outward from the Caucasus in the Arial-Caspian territory, and in the Usuri basin on the Pacific coast.   

Helped by these circumstances, the Russians not only vanquished Northern Asia; they colonized it.

The Russian Empire can be divided into two large partitions, the European and the Asiatic. The latter, comprised of almost 6.5 million square miles and a population of no more than 16 million inhabitants, may be considered colonial holdings.

The European contingent includes European Russia, Finland (actually a separate nationality looked upon to some degree as an allied state), and Poland, the very name of which has been redacted in official documents, but which nonetheless stubbornly steers its own course on its national development.
