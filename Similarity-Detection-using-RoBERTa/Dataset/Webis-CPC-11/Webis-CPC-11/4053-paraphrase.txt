Welcome, roaring moon of dust, Welcome, Spring's reviver; On the race again we must Risk the wonted fiver; 

Fields are showing brighter green, Early buds are shooting; On the early youth is seen The new season's suiting. 

Long it is since sparrows shrill With their chirping woke us; There is one with busy bill Worrying a crocus. 

How they love the flow'r of spring-- Never can resist it; What a graceful little thing-- Bother, I have miss'd it! 

Now the wind along the plain Comes with roar and clatter-- There, my hat is off again! Let it go--no matter. 

What am I, to say thee nay In thy rudest phases? Blow my Sunday hat away. Blow my hat to blazes. 

'Tis but little we can do For thy bounty's measure-- Sacrifice a hat or two? Forty hats, with pleasure.

KENSINGTON GARDENS SMALL TALK. 

FROM THE RAILWAY IMPROVEMENT PHRASE-BOOK. 

That Nursery-maid with the three children and the perambulator will certainly get run over by the train if she stands there gossiping with the man in the signal-box. 

That is the nineteenth horse that has run away and thrown its rider this morning, frightened by the smoke of the passing engine. 

So it is not, after all, a tornado that has swept across the Gardens, and rooted up all these trees, but merely the firm that has taken the contract for the making of the new line. 

Yes, there is no doubt that this wooden fence, stretching right across the Gardens, relieved by overseers' moveable hatch-houses, puffing steam-cranes, and processions of mud-carts, rather interfere with the beauty and tranquillity of the place, but one must really bear in mind that it is, after all, only to last for live years. 

Ha! I thought so! There go the whole of the water-fowl under that luggage-train. 

It is true, the Gardens are ruined, but one must not forget the inestimable advantage to the shareholders of the public being able to get from Paddington to Chelsea in a tunnel for twopence.
