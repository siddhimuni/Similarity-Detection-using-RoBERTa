Finding Lancelot gloomy, the lady of the house enquired why he was so dejected that he would neither even eat or drink nor make merry or laugh. She also persuades him to tell her the truth and assured him that he could trust her. To this he answered that do not feel surprised as his condition and he was sad that he could not attend the tournament where there will be a big gathering and that let God make you let me go there and return back to my captivity here after the tournament. She added that she would have surely let him go if she was not afraid of the total destruction including the death punishment of her husband brought by her devilish lord Meleagant who is indeed diabolic. Lancelot assured her that if he would at once return back to her after the tournament by giving her a promise that would not break. The lady then compromised with Lancelot that she would let him go if he would swear to return back and to give her all his love. On Lancelotâ€™s assurance of her request she said that there was nothing to be proud of his love for he already had a sweat heart and that she was satisfied with the rest of the love he offered her and accepted his oath to return back here as a prisoner. Followed by his oath by Holy Church, she offers him the vermilion arms of her lord and his marvellous horse.
