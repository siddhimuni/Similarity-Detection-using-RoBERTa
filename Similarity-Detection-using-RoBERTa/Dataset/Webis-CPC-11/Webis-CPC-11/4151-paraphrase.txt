       BUDAPEST(A)

One of the most beautifully situated cities in Europe is Budapest. It's hard to forget the wonderful sight of the sister towns divided bythe swift Danube, with steamers and barges floating on her.Buda is the old stronghold sits on one side with the fascinating "Gellbert" hill, that is a bunch of rocks and caves.Some farther is the royal palace with beautifully cared for gardens that cling to the side of the hill.then the older part is called the stronghold which had been rebuilt the same way and style as Mathias Corvinus built it.It was demolished during the Turkish invasion.The old church of Mathias stands here but because it has been renovated so much it dosen't look aged.Hiding behind the little hills are larger ones covered with shady woods, these serve as summer excursion places for tourists.

Greeny and shady islands are found along the Danube and St. Margaret is the prettiest.To the other side of the river is a city called"Pest" where the magestic Houses of Parliment, the Palace of Justice and other numerous fine buildings stand there.There are four bridges connecting the two cities today and a tunnel goes through the first hill in Buda to another section of town. It's hard to say which is the most beautiful sight: look from Pest, that stands on the level ground, up to the hilly view of Buda, or looking from the hillside of the other place to the beautiful land of Pest, which has the beautiful Danube receding in the distance with glittering sun playing on it.Beautiful in the daylight but so much more at night as myriads of lights twinkle on the water and the hillsides are dotted with lights.Even the local people look at this sight with wonder.What a sight it must be to foreigners!
