Solignie's mayor, learned from the Aubergiste when he stopped at the inn that the stranger was going to visit La Trappe.  Therefore, he introduced himself to me very nicely and told me the way through the forest.  He did say he was surprrised that an Englishman would do this because it was going to be an exhausting  trip and many who lived here had never attempted it.

It struck me that I could only find one person to guide me, and no one knew much about the route even though the abbey was only 25 miles away.

At dawn the guide and I started out, and I rode a small Norman horse.  We had pistols and a sword just in case wolves attacked us, as this was the major thing the people worried about.

After a while, we left the main road and traveled on a lonely country road.  It was barren and the trees were so thick that the light hardly penetrated.  We'd only gone a half mile when my dreamy mind was called to attention  when we heard the howling of a wolf.

The guide I was with made the sign of the cross and expertly cracked his whip so we could move through a particularly dense part of the forest.
He told me of recent sightings of wolves and attacks by wolves on the local peasants.  Some were killed, and in one instance a baby was torn from its mothers arms by one of these creatures and in this very neighborhood.
