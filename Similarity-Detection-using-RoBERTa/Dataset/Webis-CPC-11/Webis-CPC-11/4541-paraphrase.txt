EDUCATION IN DENMARK.

Much pain has recently been taken in Denmark to promote the financing of primary schools and Lancaster have been generally throughout the country. We now have before us the report to the King of Chevalier Abrahamson, progress, prospects and current status of schools for mutual learning in Denmark, January 28, 1828, which shows that 2371 was mutual schools created and is full time in the various districts of the kingdom and in the Army .-- North American Review.

RECORDS.

Some faint idea of the majority of our English records can be obtained by noting the fact that a single law, the Commissioners' property tax law, passed in the first year of the reign of His Majesty's present action, the more winding hundred feet, or nearly twice the length of the Cathedral of St. Paul's within the walls, and if you ever need the volume to hear fear, a healthy man should be employed for three hours in coiling and uncoiling its folds monstrous. In case of factory legislation, at this pace and do not believe any disruption in their development, we may soon be able to belt the ball round with parchment. When the solemn acts run, add requests showers available (and in more ways than one) on the table every night of the session, the bills at the end of each quarter, are stacked in piles under custody of our good friends, six employees of the Foreign Ministry, and countless membranes, as in all hours of the day, sent the gloomy caves and recesses of the various courts of common law and criminal jurisdiction throughout the kingdom, we are afraid that there are many who may think that time is fast approaching for the surgery, Hugh Peters recommends that "a good job for a good judge."
