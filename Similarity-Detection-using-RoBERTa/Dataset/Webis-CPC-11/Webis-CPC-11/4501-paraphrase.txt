A person wonders how much this work has been changed by the adoring translator, but unfortunately we don't know the Scandinavian language.  This novel, however, possesses some remarkable writing, whether it is descriptions of nature or of human life.  One of the most memorable parts of this novel is the fate of Steffen-Margaret.  Mrs Howitt, who translated "The True Story of my Life," draws attention to this character and informs us that it is based on a person whom Andersen knew somewhat towards the beginning of his career.  She points out the detailed section in the novel, but the translator of the Autobiography and of "Only a Fiddler," might have found a better way to convey the connection between the novel and the author's life.  The two characters discussed have no similarities except that they both belong to a lower class of society.  The young girl mentioned, nothing is told except that her father visited her once a week for tea, and dressed in a tattered blue coat; the point of the story is, that later when Andersen rose to a higher class of society, he met the father with the tattered blue coat in a fancy bar and he was an unremarkable old man sparkling with orders.

Christian, the protagonist in the novel, without much life experience, first arrived to Copenhagen.  While his ship was anchored at the port, it was visited by some ladies, one who catches his eye.  She must be a princess, or something similar, if not an angel.  The next day he locates her house, sees her, tells her about his life, his hopes and dreams; he is sure that he has found a powerful patroness.  The lady smiles at him, and with a pat on the head tells him to leave after offering him some cakes and sweetmeats.  This is just what Andersen would have done in real life at this age.  In the Autobiography there is a very similar scene.
