A reason sugar has a high food value is it is a ready source of energy, but if taken between meals, it increases caloric intake and if not utilized may be stored in the body.

[Sidenote: Water with Meals:]

For most people, one or two glassfuls of water,taken with meals, is not objectionable, as long as it is not taken while food is in the mouth. This could lead to choking.

[Sidenote: The Digestibility of So-called "Indigestible" Foods]

The science of dietetics will rapidly develop in the future, and will probably be more definite than we've been here. 
At present much is unknown,especially as to how rules have to be modified for the particular individual. Personal idiosyncrasies have to be taken into account. "What is one man's meat, is another man's poison." On the other hand, many have misjudged ideas as to their own idiosyncrasies. For instance, many people think nuts do not agree with them, or that nuts are indigestible, when the trouble is they are not chewing nuts fully and properly, or the nus are over roasted. Ordinary peanuts are often over roasted. Slightly roasted peanuts, when properly chewed have seldom disagreed with people. Others believe that bananas never agree with them, when in fact they eat them before they fully ripen and are too green. The ignorant public buys bananas when they are an even green. While the banana vendor knows the banana isn't fully ripe until it's peel is yellow and mottled with black.

[Sidenote: Avoidance of Fads]

Each individual must use common sense and intelligence to avoid accepting a "fad" without sufficient evidence to it's claims. Also he must not cling to customs simply because they are familiar, thus mistaking scientific conclusions, which do not adhere to these customs, as fads.
