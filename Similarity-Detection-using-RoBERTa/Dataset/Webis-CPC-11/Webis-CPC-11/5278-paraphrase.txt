The powder mixes with the oleic acid when the tube is screwed in the socket. The water coming in at first makes the linseed powder viscid. Later the steam forming the oleate of lime and the oleate of lead, on its way to the outer air, presses it in the holes and closes them perfectly. After a year in use the tubes can be unscrewed with ease, and the screw threads are perfectly smooth.One exception must be made, it is only tight under pressure; condensation or vacuum must be thoroughly avoided.--Chem.

In answer to  inquiries  of this article, we give herewith the process of William Henry Balmain, the original discoverer of luminous paint. These particulars are derived from the letters patent granted in this country to the parties named.


Balmain's invention was patented in England in 1877, and in this country in 1882. It is styled as Improvements in Painting, Varnishing, and Whitewashing, of which the following is a specification.  A luminous paint, the body of which is a phosphorescent compound, or is composed in part of such a compound, and the vehicle of which is such as is used as the vehicle in ordinary paint compounds, viz., one which becomes dry by evaporation or oxidation.

The objector article to which such paint applied is itself rendered visible in the darkest place, capable of imparting light to other objects, so as to render them visible. The phosphorescent substance found most suitable for the purpose is a compound obtained by simply heating together a mixture of  carbonate of lime and sulphur, or some of the various substances containing in themselves both lime and sulphur--such, for example, as alabaster, gypsum, and the like--with carbon or other agent to remove a portion of the oxygen contained in them.

It may be any of the vehicles commonly used in oil-painting or any of those commonly used in what is known as "distemper" painting or whitewashing, according to the place or purpose in or for which the paint is to be used. The vehicle  used for the luminous paint must be one which will dry by evaporation  paint may not become soft or fluid by heat or be liable to be easily rubbed off by accident. 

The mode of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will also depend upon the circumstances of the case. For example, it may be applied by a brush, as in ordinary painting, or by dipping or steeping the article in the paint, varnish, or wash; or a block or type may be used to advantage, as in calico-printing and the like. For outdoor work, or wherever the surface illuminated is exposed to the alterations of weather or to injury from mechanical contingencies. It is desirable to cover it with glass, or to glaze it over with a flux, as in enameling, or as in ordinary pottery, and this may be accomplished without injury to the effect, even when the flux or glaze requires a red heat for fusion.

Among other applications may be enumerated, it is particularly advantageous for rendering visible clock or watch faces and other indicators. as compasses and the scales of barometers or thermometers--during the night or in dark places during the night time. In applying the invention to these and other like purposes there may be used either phosphorescent grounds with dark figures or dark grounds and phosphorescent figures or letters, preferring the former. In like manner there may be produced figures etc, wherever it is not convenient or economical to have external source of light, signposts, and signals, and names or marks to show entries to avenues or gates, and the like.

The invention is also applicable to the illumination of railway carriages by painting with phosphorescent paint a portion of the interior, reducing the necessity for the expense and inconvenience of the use of lamps in passing through tunnels.
