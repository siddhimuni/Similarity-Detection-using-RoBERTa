My horse being quite knocked up, it was dark before we could reach a
spot where we could obtain water and grass; having come to a convenient place, we bivouacked
under a large overhanging rock, as it promised to be a wet night.

7th October.

At 6.0 a.m. we were in our saddles, but owing to the rocky nature of the country did not arrive
at the encampment till 12.30 p.m. During our absence the party had been successful in fishing
and shooting; a savoury mess of cockatoos, swans, and ducks, with fried fish, proved a welcome
change to us, after living so many weeks on salt meat and damper.

8th October (Sunday).

9th October.

The valley of the river being rocky and impassable above the camp, we crossed to the left bank
and ascended the sandy tableland; steered about south-east from 7.45 a.m. to 11.0, when we
came on the stream in a deep valley formed by almost perpendicular red sandstone cliffs from
50 to 200 feet in height, broken at short intervals by enormous fissures (their general direction
west-north-west and nearly at right angles with the river), which time, with the action of
water, had worn into impassable ravines, frequently extending more than half a mile back from
the river, and rendered travelling very tedious and unsafe, as it was requisite to avoid the
thick scrubs covering the higher land. The course of the river now changed to nearly south,
and preserved the same rocky and unapproachable character till 5.0 p.m., when a break in the
cliffs enabled us to descend into the valley, although with some difficulty and danger to the
horses, which had to slide down the steep rocks at the risk of breaking their necks, which
would have been the almost certain result of a single false step; but the descent being accomplished,
they were rewarded by an abundant supply of grass and water, the latter from a large spring
at the foot of the cliffs.
