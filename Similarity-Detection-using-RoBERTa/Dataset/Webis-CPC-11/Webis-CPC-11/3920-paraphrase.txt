Lawless Court, Rochford, Essex .-- A most extraordinary is usually in a mansion at Rochford, in accordance with tenants holding what is called "Lawless Court." This court takes place at midnight, by lantern light in the center of a field on the first Friday after September 29, and is chaired by the manor steward, who, however, appoint a deputy to perform this part of the debt . Tenants of the manor are required to attend to respond to their names when asked, under pain of heavy fine, or at all events there will have some answer for them. All procedures are conducted in silence, not speaking above that tone of voice and data on deaths, name, & C are placed in a book by the president with a piece of charcoal. I might add, the business is started by a black cock to three times, and sometimes is a difficult issue to get the rooster to do his duty, a man is hired nigga, whose duty it is to 5s.

Now Morant, in his History of Essex, only cursorily mentioned that usually the most singular, and has nothing about antiquity or origin, I feel, therefore, very grateful for any information on it.
