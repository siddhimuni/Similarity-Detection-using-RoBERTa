When we look at any map we are bound to wonder why some rivers terminate in a delta, while others in an estuary.  For example, the Thames, which is the reason for the riches and power of London, terminates into a splendid estuary.  The Thames could not have excavated this estuary at its present level but it dates back to a period when the south-east of England stood at a comparatively higher level.  Then the land stood high, the German ocean was once dry land when the Thames ran northwards after joining the Rhine and eventually draining into the Arctic Ocean.  There were once under water, the sites of deltas of the present day, for example that of Nile and formed by the sediments of the river.
The rivers do not always tend to deepen their valleys and they do so only when the slope is steep.  Otherwise there is a tendency to raise their beds by deposits of sand and mud from higher levels.  That is why most of the celebrated rivers - like the Nile, the Po, the Mississippi, the Thames, etc., run on self made embankments. 
The most dangerous of the Apennine Rivers, The Reno is up to 30 feet above the adjoining country, at some points.  When not impeded, such rivers, run past their banks and form new course along the lowest part of their valley.  If they are not contained in their own channels by human interference, these rivers alter their courses continually.
A river flowing down an evenly inclined plane in almost a straight line would be vacillated by any obstacle.  This could only be countered by an equal gravitational pull exerted on the water falling downwards. The curves are widespread if the fall is 10 feel per mile, since the radius depends on the volume of water and angle of inclination of the bed. According to Fergusson, the curve formed is about six times the width of the river, for a fall of 1 foot per mile.  So it is very difficult to alter the natural oscillation, and literally it is a waste of time and effort.
