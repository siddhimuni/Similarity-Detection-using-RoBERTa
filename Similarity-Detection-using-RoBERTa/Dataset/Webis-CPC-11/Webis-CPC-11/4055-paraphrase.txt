I see it is if the two pictures he was kind enough to send me, being a square stereographs [] T-square, located in the intersection points towards the observer, and remove from his tail, and a angle if the market is the center of radiation, and while its distance from the camera is only six feet of separation points no less than three feet apart.

To push the argument to extremes to test its value is quite right, but this goes far beyond the extreme, it can be allowed such an expression very Hibernian.

No object, however minute, can be clearly seen when brought closer to the eye than a point, because it will be what is technically called the focus. It is true that this point varies in different people, but the average distance is 10 inches healthy vision. Now, adopting MR. Merritt own standard of 2 Â½ inches between the eyes, it is clear that the focus is supposed to have been selected correctly, the distance between cameras was just what might have been taken away double extreme. There is no need to suggest what a person devoid of taste (category I, which are undoubtedly included) could be in production by adopting the method radial monstrosities, such a one is not likely to produce good results all.

I turn now to another charge me. It is true that I am unacquainted with the tenets of academic perspective, but equally true that we familiar with their deeds, as must any one who has studied the optical and geometrical science in general, and while I agree, set out proposals for a picture with one eye, I by no means agree with the assumption that points to "loss" in both radial stereographs taken precautions, "should be so far, that they could not flow in a stereoscope, "on the experiment, by contrast, direct show me what reason suggests also that they flow into one such as complete when viewed by both eyes.
