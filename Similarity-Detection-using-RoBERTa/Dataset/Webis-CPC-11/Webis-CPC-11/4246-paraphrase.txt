The glowing, fire-eyed sun in glory dies in the west; And the bird with dreamy crest, And soft , sun-loving breast, When throbbing day is done, floats skiwkt in to the west.

Oh, everything lovely and fair is floating in tothe west. Tis and unknown land, where our hopes must go, And all lthings beautiful, fluttering slow; Our joys all wait for us there.--Far out in the dim blue west.

IS COTTON OURKING?

BY A COTTON-SPINNER

No falsehood has been so persistently adhered to by the southem p;anters and their adovocates, and so successfully forced upon the credulity of the North, as the statement that white men can not perform field labor in the cotton states,coupled with the equally false assertion that the emancipated negro lapses into barbarism,and ceases to be an industrious labourer.It is one of the chief points of weakness in a bad cause, that, although single advocate may succeed in rendering it plausible, many are certain to present utterly irreconcilablearguments, An impartial man,examining De Bow's Review for a series of years, would arrive at conclusions in regard to the economy of slave labor, and the necessity of colored laborers in the Southem States,the verv reverse of what the writers have intended to enforce.

It is constantly asserted that white men can not labor in the tropics, which we may freely admit;but the inferencethat the climate of the Southem States is tropical sw have the best authority for denying:firstly, from the tastimony of all Southem writers when descnbing their own section of country, and not arguing upon the slavery question;and secondly,from Jumboldt's isothermal lines, by which we find that the temperature of the cotton states is the same as that of Portugat,the south of Spain,Italy,and Australia.Do we find Australian emigrants writing home to their friends not to come out because they will not be able to work?We know they do not;and yet the mean annual temperature of Australia is 70-- greater by five to six degrees than that of Texas; and, from the best account we can get, the extreme of heat is very much greater.
