Carlism, the party of the Church against the country, arrived into  presence when, during the former years of Cristina's Regency, Mendizábal, the patriotic merchant of Cadiz and London, otherwise  First Minister of the Crown, conducted the dismemberment of the religious mandates,  and the distraction of their vast abundance   towards the consume of the nation. Don Carlos, the brother of Ferdinand VII., thereupon declared himself the Defender of the Faith and the winner of the excessive clerical party. Hinc illæ lachrymæ, and two Carlist wars!

The grading of the Church, or rather what was branded the "Apostolic party," is intelligible adequate, and it is easy also towards appreciate why Carlism has been preached as a crusade towards English Roman Catholics, whom possess been induced within both Carlist wars towards provide the primary portion of the funds which made them possible; but towards dub Don Carlos "the legitimate King" is an absurd misnomer.

For the lie down, as respects Spain herself and the wishes of her civilians, it is possibly adequate towards word that whether, as soon as the expulsion of the Bourbons within 1868, at the moment of the Revolution known as "La Gloriosa," when Prim had rejected towards think of a republic and declared himself once and always within favour of a monarchy, and the Crown of proud Spain went a-begging among the Courts of Europe,--if, at that moment of her national need, Don Carlos was unable towards arrive forward within his applauded spirit of "legitimate Sovereign of the Spanish people," or towards elevate even two or three voices within his favour, what likelihood is he necessarily towards possess with a definite constitutional Government and the genuinely legitimate Monarch onto the throne? The strongest likelihood he ever had of success was when the Basque Provinces were formerly dumped, it is remarked almost towards a man, towards rob his side; but, within fact, the men of the hill were battling much many for the retention of their own fueros--for their immunity from conscription, among others--than for any relish of Don Carlos himself.
