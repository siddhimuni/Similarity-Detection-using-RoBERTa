E-ne-pee--vapor bath is used as a purification preparatory to the sacred feasts. The vapor
bath is taken in this way: "A number of poles the size of hoop-poles or less are taken, and
their larger ends being set in the ground in a circle, the flexible tops are bent over and
tied in the centre. This frame work is then covered with robes and blankets, a small hole being
left on one side for an entrance. Before the door a fire is built, and round stones about the
size of a man's head are heated in it. When hot, they are rolled within, and the door being
closed, steam is made by pouring water on them. The devotee, stripped to the skin, sits within
this steam-tight dome, sweating profusely at every pore, until he is nearly suffocated. Sometimes
a number engage in it together and unite their prayers and songs." "Tahkoo Wakan," p. 83. Father
Hennepin was subjected to the vapour-bath at Mille Lacs by Chief Aqui-pa-que-tin, two hundred
years ago. After describing the method Hennepin says: "When he had made me sweat thus three
times in a week, I felt as strong as ever." Shea's Hennepin, p. 228. For a very full and accurate
account of the Medicine men of the Dakotas, and their rites etc., see Chap. II, Neill's Hist.
Minnesota.

82 The sacred O-zu-ha--or Medicine-sack must be made of the skin of the otter, the coon, the
weasel, the squirrel, the loon, a certain kind of fish or the skins of serpents.
