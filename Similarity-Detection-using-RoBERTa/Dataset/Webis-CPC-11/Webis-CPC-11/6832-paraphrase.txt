As if a snake had bitten her, she stopped short and screamed in pain because the one who had always listened closely to her, Jasper Losely, suddenly laughed in contempt when confronted with the idea of having to get married, so she was insulted to the core.

Despite her cry of anger and pain, he continued to laugh and stood up.  He looked at himself in the mirror and experienced a very different feeling at what he saw then his companion did when she mournfully did just a few moments prior.

Regaining his composure, he said that it all seemed like such a joke to him when she'd brought up the topic of marriage.

She needed to get rid of that idea, he told her (Crane), for they could never be married happily as they knew each other too well.  Maybe she loved him, but lots of women loved him and they always do because they can't help themselves. He hadn't a clue why except that women seemed to love bad boys like him.

He told her to cheer up as the clock struck seven because he was going to meet some fellows he hardly knew at the race track.  He said she should find Sophy or Rugge to scold if she needed to and asked her never to mention the word marriage again as anyone would be scared to death of it.

We don't know if she heard those last words.  However, if Losely had turned to see her wretched face at that moment, it wouldn't have made a great deal of difference to him and he might have begun laughing again or just left to cover up a momentary uneasiness.
