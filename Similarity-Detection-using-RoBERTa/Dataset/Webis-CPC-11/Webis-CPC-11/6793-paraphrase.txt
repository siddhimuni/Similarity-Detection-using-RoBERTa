His quite imposing list of works may includes a Regulus(1885), an overture a concert overture (1884), , an operetta , symphony [1885]", were performed in Munich and in London.

 "Count Robert of Paris" (1890),was performed in New York, a ballad for choristers and ensemble, "King Trojan," represented in Munich in 1885, the Twenty-third Psalm for female choristers and ensemble, (1884).

 "Idylle" (1891); "The Normans," "The Kobolds," and "Harold Harfager," all for choristers and ensemble, and all dated 1891; an oratorio, three or more cantatas, and various bits of chamber-music.
