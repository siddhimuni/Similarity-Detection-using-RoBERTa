Mr. J.
H. Slater's 'Early Editions . . . of Modern Authors,' which appeared in 1894, will be of value
to you, though like all works which deal with current prices it now needs revision. From the
bibliographical standpoint it is excellent, but the safest guides to mere market values are
the quarterly records of auction-sale prices entitled 'Book-Auction Records,' and the bi-monthly
publication known as 'Book-Prices Current' issued by Mr. Elliot Stock. In addition there are
bibliographies of almost all the greatest Victorian writers.

There is no doubt that the early editions of the English classics will get more and more valuable
as time goes on. In the case of many it may be years before any decided rise in their sale-room
price takes place; but as the number of book-collectors increases with the population, while
the number of copies of these desiderata tends to become less owing to the absorption of certain
of them in the public libraries, so it is only natural that increased competition should result
in a corresponding increase in their value.

The early editions of Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher, and of the later Elizabethan and Stuart
dramatists, which command but a few pounds to-day, will run, in all probability, well into
three figures during the next half-century. A good copy of the first issue of Milton's 'Comus,'
printed in 1637, could be had for £36 in 1864. In 1898 one with the title-page mended brought
£150. Ten years later £317 was not thought excessive for it, whilst in 1916 a fine and perfect
copy made £800. $14,250 was the ransom of a copy at New York in 1919.

Other books there are which have had similar meteoric rises in value. The first edition of
Walton and Cotton's 'Compleat Angler' was published in 1653 at one and sixpence. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century the average price for a fine copy seems to have been between three
and four pounds. In 1850 so much as fifteen pounds was paid for a copy in a similar state.
