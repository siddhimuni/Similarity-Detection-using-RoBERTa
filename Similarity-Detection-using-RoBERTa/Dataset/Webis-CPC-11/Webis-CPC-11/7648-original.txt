Urquhart,
that polished and gifted Scottish d'Artagnan, translated the first three books only; the last
two were added by Motteux, a French refugee, in 1694. Urquhart's work, 'precise, elegant, and
very faithful,' comes as near perfection as any translation can hope to be. Motteux's rendering
was revised by Ozell; but unfortunately it falls far short of the version of Sir Thomas, who,
with a longer life, might perhaps have undertaken these last two books as well.

Of these five books of Master Francis Rabelais thus english'd, there have been, of course,
numerous editions. Our book-hunter prefers that which appeared in three quarto volumes in 1904,
with photogravure illustrations by M. Louis Chalon.
