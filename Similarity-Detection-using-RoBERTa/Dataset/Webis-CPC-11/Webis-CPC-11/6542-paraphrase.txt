Bridget's knowledge of human nature makes her truly different from other older sisters. She is far more cold and manipulative. Her problem was that she wanted her little sister to marry a rich man, and she wanted to profit from this as well. It was no surprise when the soldier Nelly loved went missing, because it looked like Bridget's wish would come true. Just when it looked as though everything was falling into place, she learned that the brother-in-law she didn't want might be the man in the hospital with a broken memory. Mrs. Humphrey Ward was not one to fear melodrama: an enviable skill indeed. The two visits to the camp at X----(whose thin disguise will not occlude the memory of any contemporary Englishman) were wonderful. The last chapters were as moving as anything Mrs. Ward has given us in her populist style and profound manner.

Mr. E. F. Benson has been developing a large history of the middle-aged. His protagonists have been at least middle-aged, and the title of his new novel, An Autumn Solving (Collins), made me feel more expectant than surprised. The cover art depicted an elderly man eyeing a much younger girl, and this gives away some of the surprises of the book. However, even to a jaded reviewer, this Benson novel has the humor and insight I've come to expect. I will not reveal too much of the plot. The romantic tales describe Keeling, a father, husband, tradesman, mayor, and baronet, and his feelings for his young secretary. The secretary's work in Keeling's library reveals the author's genius, as the plot pivots upon it. Keeling's wife is a woolly-witted matron quite at home in Benson's work, who is both comic and horrible in turn. The book will be met with great welcome.

Sir Sidney Colvin has been engaged in his biography of John Keats, and his biography, "Life of John Keats," combines a rare blend of scholarship and empathy, as well as clarity and enthusiasm. Colvin retired from his work at the Print Room of the British Museum, and has been preparing since first opening the "magic casement" to write this biography.
