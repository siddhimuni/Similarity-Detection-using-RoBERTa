When accosted never stop, never draw out watch or box of lights, and never know the way anywhere. always make a guess good at the time, and swear you have no matches about you. it is wonderful to notice kind hearted ladies stoppinng to give to stalwart beggars who are only waiting for an opportunity to smarch purses, and it would be interesting to know how many annually lose their purses and watches through this mistaken method of distributing largess. 

Let me conclude by saying that, if you want to be as safe as possible in a doubtful neighourhood, your best friends are a quick ear, a quick year, a quick eye, a quick step, and a predilection for the middle of the road. The two former help you to detect, as the two latter may enable you to avoid a sudden onslaught.
