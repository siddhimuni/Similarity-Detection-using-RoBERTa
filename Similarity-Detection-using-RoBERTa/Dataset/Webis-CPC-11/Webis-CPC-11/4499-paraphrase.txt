My mother was an English woman who had  born and partly brought up in Paris. She was tall and beautiful. In the meantime my father was a Frechman who had born and partly brought up in London. He was such a gay and jovial man. 
    He was a talented  musician gifted with a magnificient voice. He had studied music for three years at the Paris conservatoire . He wanted to sing at the opera. But his superstitious parents cannot allow him to such a godless career. So the world lost a great singer and to the great singer the world of wealth and fame.
          Both he and his wife had money that can support their lives and he spent this money for scientific inventions which were fruitless. 
    He sang only to amuse his wife and to gain energy  and to charm tne servants and everyone who are keen to listen and last (and most) to myself. I only inherited a little  talent of my father. Besides my mother was also a great musician who play harp and piano.She used to play at night . I used to open the doors of drawing room and my bedroom so that I could hear her till I fell asleep.
