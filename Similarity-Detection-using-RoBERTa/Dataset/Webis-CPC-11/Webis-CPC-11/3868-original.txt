Her aunt, although kind,
indulgent, and pitying her, (for in youth she had had experience of a blighted affection, and
no woman-heart, that is not naturally sour, passes through such trial without becoming sweeter)--was
bound in complete serfdom to her brother, and was quite unable to suggest any means or likelihood
of release; so Barbara wrote a full account of her predicament to her lover. Not long afterward,
so cleverly disguised by dress as to deceive even herself, Percival was again at Aberdeen--determined,
should all other methods fail, to carry off his kinswoman on the very eve of the bridal; and
many a twilight evening, when the minister sat over books or took his after-dinner nap, did
those two young creatures meet, unnoticed and unsuspected, on the banks of the Dee. But those
meetings must soon end, for six months have passed, and Mr. Bruce--once more lodged in the
house of Davy Bain--is come to wed and take home his reluctant bride.

One evening--it was cloudy and threatened foul weather, though the summer air was warm and
surcharged with flower-scents--John Percival betook himself as usual to the customary trysting-place.
It was a thick copse of hazel past which ran--heard but not seen--the river; which, where the
shrubbery ended, formed a dark, deep pool, so garnished by overhanging nut-trees that it had
acquired the name of the Nut-hole. Beyond this pool lay the road to the manse; but as the trees
here ceased to offer concealment, the Nut-tree-hole became the limits to Percival's attendance
on his cousin in her way homeward.
