When I was seventeen I made a dear friend when I was at a great castle.  I can imagine it as if it were yesterday and can envision the beautiful courtyard, the columns, the courtyard, the sculptures and adornments.  There were school desks, also, and school uniforms, because 500 young people gathered there to learn.  So much young life in those voices and laughs: the slim and the heavy, the athletic and the scholars, some like girls while others very masculine. They came from Tuscany and Venice and Naples, speaking all the dialects, from all classes and walks of life.  Shopkeeper sons mingled with those from royalty. They talked of women and of war, of their ambitions and of their hopes for the future and feelings about life.

That was 1865 at the Unive
