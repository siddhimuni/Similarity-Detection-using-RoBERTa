The entire view was amazing. To truly appreciate it, it would have been better to not have to inhale insects. 

The most difficult of a all difficulties are ones that are continuous and can only be fended off by persistence. It is likely, that the excretions of the woods of the Cassiquiare M. Bonpland drank the fruits of a extreme sickness, which he almost collapsed under upon our appearance at Angostura. Luckily for both of us, we did not know beforehand the threat that he was facing. The sounds of nature around us was a bit continuous. However, our cheerfulness allowed us some relief during this difficult time. We found that we could eat small amounts of dried cacao mixed finely with sugar while imbibing extreme amounts of the water from the river we were able to to fend off our need for food for part of the day. The insects bothered us more than the environmental difficulties and physical need. Despite the difficulties we encountered on our trip to Cordilleras, the excursions from Mandavaca to Esmeralda was, to us, the most filled with tribulation  compared to our other excursions in the New World. I would recommend that people who desire to observe the large divide of the Orinoco, to take another way than we did. 

The Cassiquiare goes in one continuous trajectory running south-west to north-east above Cano Duractumuni. We were shocked by the gorge like boundaries to the Cassiquiare were caved in by the abrupt rise of the water level. Trees toppled by this became natural boats and unseen to canoe captains because of their submersion in the mire were quite dangerous. We slept the night of May 20th, the last of our journey on the Cassiquiare, close to the split of the Orinoco.
