In so much that by the passing of the broader lines through one of his greater points it is expected that it will cut another proposed line into two parts of equal sizing.  We are expected to understand that the middle width of previously mentioned line is distinguished by passing through the middle point marking as two equal parts.  

Further consideration would be recommended that, Euclide by a line is seen as no more than what is seen by Mr. Hobs in his view of the middle breadth. Euclides point is the same as Mr. Hobs' middle point.  By that same token Mr.Hobs' middle having no magnitude as the very middle rather than the whole middle.  The whole of the middle won't be equal to it's two halves rather, larger than both as much as the middle comes to.  No breadth of Euclide's lines are perceived and his points having no great size.

Similarly viewed, when Euclide makes the terminal end of the line as do others likewise then it is not the outer half of the point ending the line, (as the inner-half manifested as not the end but rather the outer half is beyond it).  Again Parts of the Outer Half, not quite the outer part but rather the far outer part of that part on and on into infinitum. As long as any of the line is left over we're not quite at the end consequently passing beyond the whole length as though when the entire length is passed there would be nothing left.  If Mr. Hobs explains such as in page 3, that this (292).  Serving our turn well not as Punctum but only as Signum which he not at all allows non esse nomen Quanti.
