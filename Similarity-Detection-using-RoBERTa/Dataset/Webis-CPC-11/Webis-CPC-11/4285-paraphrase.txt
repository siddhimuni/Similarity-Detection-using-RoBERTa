Note On PALAMON AND ARCITE.

It probably has often been noted as somewhat curious that Chaucer, in describing the arrival of Palamon and Arcite in Athens, day of week mentioned that this takes place:

"And in this wise these lordes and some Ben Sonday come to read," & C.

Nothing seems to depend on their coming on one day of the week rather than another. In reality, however, this seemingly insignificant is astrologically connected with the issue of competition. Palamon, who next morning is prayer Venus finally manages to win Emelie, while Arcite, who applauds Mars, he wins the tournament. Both prayers are granted, because both are at their tutelary deities at times that these deities that preside. To understand this, we must call to mind the astrological explanation (132) days of the week names. According to Dio Cassius, the Egyptians divided the day in twenty-four hours, and requires each to be a particularly influenced by some one of the planets. The first hour of the day had the prerogative to give his name, or rather that of the planet on which he was subjected to a full day. For example, Saturn chair the first hour of the day, his name is called, Jupiter the second, and so on; month as the lowest of the planets, chair of the seventh. Again, the eighth is subject to Saturn, and the same cycle repeats fifteenth and twenty-two hours. Twenty-third hour is, therefore, subject to Jupiter, Mars and twenty-fourth.
