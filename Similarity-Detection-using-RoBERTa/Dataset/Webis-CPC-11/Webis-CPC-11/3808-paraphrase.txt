There are many plans being drawn up for beautiful new parks and recreation areas around Boston. First, from Leverett Street to Brighton, there are plans to create beautiful footpaths following the water, accompanied by new flowers and trees. Much of the remaining natural habitat of the area will be preserved, save for about 200 feet for a driveway and a saddle-pad or horse way.

Designs are also underway to turn the Back Bay (which at the moment Dr. Clarke accurately calls a cesspool) into a sort of inland sea. Most of the bay will be kept underwater, but the ocean can be let in and out at will in order to keep the water fresh and pure. This improved area would be large enough to hold grand regattas and house multiple boats and sculls simultaneously.

Then, there are plans to create a mountain-like park in the West Roxbury area. If completed according to plan, this would be the largest park of its kind, spanning about 500 acres. The area in this proposed park is high and rocky, giving visitors a feel of hiking through the forest, miles and miles away from the bustling city.

These and many other parks proposed for the Boston area will provide for a better use of previously untouched land, as most of these areas cannot be developed for homes or industry. In order to make the new park areas accessible to the public, parkways will be developed in order to connect these new areas by railroad. As a whole, these recreational areas are intended to provide a convenient, pleasant and affordable area for visitors to relax and have fun.
