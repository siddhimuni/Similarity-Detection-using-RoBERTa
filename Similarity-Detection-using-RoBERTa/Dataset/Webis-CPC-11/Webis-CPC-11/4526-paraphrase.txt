What deters man from evil deeds, is not the severity of punishment, but the likelihood of punishment. This is because one's hope i.e. belief about what could happen is foremost on the mind.

Commanding one to be in a certain way is completely opposite to showing by example how one should be. The first is often uncomfortable and limiting, yet the second is often overly descriptive.

Most people will not stand up for a political cause, until the issue at hand directly affects them.

New friendships are laden with extra kindness, and it is not unusual when that kidness subsides to normal levels as the relationship continues.

Reminisce bit by bit

Come and listen gentlemen, about the good navy man who hath the blood of a free-born named Robin Hood.

It has been a long time since the time of the theif who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, but the tale is still told, and remains delightful to hear.  Both hisotorians and writers find the tale bustling with energy that will last forever, and even after six or seven hundred years since their time, Robin Hood and Little John are names known by all. 

To the best of what is known, Robin Hood was born in 1160 A.D. in Nottingham during the reign of King Henry II. Although his real name was Robert Fitzoothes, poor pronounciations eventually led to the modern name Robin Hood. It is believed that he was Earl of Huntington, which is a descendent from Ralph Fitzoothes.  Fitzoothes was a Norman and came to England with a man by the name of William Rufus.  He married Maud the daughter of Gilbert de Gaunt, and apparently in the later part of his life held some pretentions toward.  

One story has it that Robin Hood's first exploits, occured in a forest, whereupon he got into a fight with some woodmen, who taunted him because the bow he had was to strong to use.  Robin Hood then demonstrated his ability and the men were angered by his showing off.

Whether this is true one can not be sure.  Other accounts suggest that in his youth he was especially wild, and lived very extravagantly, that he quickly blew through his inheritnace and turned to a life of crime.
