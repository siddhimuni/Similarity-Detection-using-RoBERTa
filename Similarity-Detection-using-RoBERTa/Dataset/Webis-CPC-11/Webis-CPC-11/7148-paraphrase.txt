Growing weary of all three, he was soon introduced to a Judith Ruddiger, a brassy widow with flaming red lipstick. She terrorized the highways in her massive roadster, played golf like a man, and ingratiated herself with the wilder nature of Frensham.  Not much time passed before the couple ran away together, to my slight dismay. From all the talk of their grand plans, I had expected more from their elopement than the clichéd trip to Monte Carlo and chain of five-star accommodations. Judith had an obnoxious way of addressing her paramour as “partner,” which brought to mind nothing less than a Wild West cowboy. Her mannerisms must have been seen as embarrassingly gauche in a gathering of educated schoolmasters, and soon Frensham tired of them as well. In the meantime, Frensham’s lawfully wedded wife, who indeed has appeared in quite a positive light in my memoirs, had refused to grant a divorce. You can no doubt guess where this story is headed, although some pleasure may yet be derived from the reading. Note Mr. Deeping’s bravery in bringing his woman-warrior Judith nearly to the edge of tragedy, threatening Frensham once or twice at gunpoint. A meek author could not have conceived of such a confrontation, and I wondered how Mr. Pelissier might have treated the situation if he were still alive.

Perhaps the novelist Evelyn Braxscombe Petter felt that her work was not modern enough unless she threw in a German secret agent. Maybe she in fact took it upon herself to help the war effort by commenting on the notion of honor in Teutonic society.
Regardless of the author’s motives, the character of Gretchen Meyer is skillfully rendered, even if the deeper aspects of her psychology are not clarified in Miss Velanty’s Disclosure. Despite being English educated and having to lean on English friends for support, Gretchen maintains a hostile attitude toward English customs, as seen in her selfish neutrality. In particular, her habit of downplaying the value of honesty and plain dealing could rub the typical Englishman the wrong way.
The end result, Gretchen’s ultimatum that the man who loves her must choose between his English values and her affections, seems unnecessary and ridiculous. The reader should not be surprised that he wisely rebuffs the German temptress. There was likely no other choice in the author’s mind; although Gretchen as a heroine is at times almost sympathetic in her grace and beauty, the writer never quite lets us forget that Gretchen’s traits are meant to repulse and disgust us.
While representing an informative study of German dishonesty, and on the whole not badly written, this reviewer cannot recommend this novel as a better choice for light reading than the evening newspaper.

Dick Ryder, the genial highwayman created by Mr. H.B. Marriott Watson, has been generously acclaimed by the author’s own publishing agents at Methuen.

Equipped with a small dagger and pistol, Ryder swashbuckles his way through the book and cows his foes into submission with silly epithets not much heard, I should think, since the glory days of James II. Had the protagonist’s exploits been in the slightest bit plausible, the plots of As It Chanced would have been more enjoyable. Fights such as these, in which the hero pulls off impossible stunts that miraculously defeat gangs of murderous thugs, surely never occurred in real life. On one particularly dull day, reading The House on the Downs admittedly provided some amusement; the book did have a few imaginative scenes, unless my memory fails me. However, these tales serve as mediocre and overly formulaic fare for diversion. Maybe, “as it chanced,” I was only suffering from indigestion brought on by a substandard lunch, but I believe that only the most dedicated fans of Marriott Watson will find this collection worthwhile entertainment.
