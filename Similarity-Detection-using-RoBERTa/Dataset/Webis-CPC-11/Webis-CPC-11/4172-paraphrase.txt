His catalouge of Swift's vices was far more interesting than that of our preacheand the gossip he told was far more malicious and detailed.It was clear there was nothing Swift could do to please all of his readers.If their hostile reactions meant anything, thethat the political connections and high-church sympathies prevented him many of his contemporaries from reacting to the virtues of Gulliver's Travels, and that to the contrary, his main work was checked for evidence of suspected author's impeity and partisan.

This hostility presisted into the eighteenth century and can be seen in the ancedote told in the 1780's by the son of "Great Man" Horace Walpole and was highly praised in the book Letter from a Clergyman.

Though a good writer Swift had a bad heart.Up to the end he was devoured by ambition.After finding his opposition to the clergy fruitless it galled him more, contemned, he wrote up a resolution to wait for Sir Robert Walpole. Sir Walpole noticed Swift looked sick and inquired the condition of his health, with usual English humour. They were near a window overlooking the courtyard where an old ivy dropping near the ground.Swift replied," Sir, I am like that ivy. I want support." Sir Robert then said," Why did you attach yourself to the falling wall? Swift turned and went to bed.
