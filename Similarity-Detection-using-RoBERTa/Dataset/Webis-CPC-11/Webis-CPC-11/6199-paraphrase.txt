i followed this struggle,as unexpected as it was significant,through the thrilling course of its success and reverses.still i did not remain entirely without company.in july,felix drasecke,whom i had not known before,came to lucerne for a lengthy visit. after hearing a performance of the prelude to tristanund lsolde conducted by liszt, he had almost immediately determined to make himself personally acquained with me. i was completely terrid by his arrivel,and was at a loss to know what to do with him. moreover,as his talk was in a certain facetious vein,overflowing with stories of persons and circumstances for which i was gradully losing all appreciation, he soon began to bore me, afact which astonished him,and which he recognised so clearly that he thought he had beeter leave after a few days.this made me in my turn embarrassed, and inow took special care to deprive him of the bad opinion he had formed of me. isoon learned to like him,and for a considerable time,until shortly before his departure from lucerne, he was my daily companion,from whose intercourse iderived much plesre,as he was a highly gifted musician and by no means a prig.but drasecke was not my only visitor

Wilhelm Baumgartner, my old Zurich acquaiance, came to spend a fewweek in Luceme out of kindness to me. And lastly Alexander set off from St.peterburg came to stay sometime in the neighbourhood. he was aremarkableman,of great intelligence, and openly prepossessed in favour of Liszt and myselfe.He had heard my Lohengrin in Dresden and wanted to know more of me--an ambition I was obliged to satisfy by playing tristan to him in the roug-and-read fashion which was peculiar to me.i went up mount pilatus with Drasecke,and again had to look after a companion who suffered from giddiness. To celebrate his departure I invited him to take an excursion to Brunner and the Gruel.After this we took leave of each other for the time being,as his moderate resources did not permit him to remain any longer, and I too was seriously thinking of takingmy departure.

the qustion now arose as to where Iwas to go .i had addressed letters,first through Eduard Devrient,and finally direct to the Grand Duke of Baden .asking the iatter for a guarantee that I might settle,if not in Karlsruhe itselfe,at least in some small place in the neighbourhood.this would suffice to set at  rest a craving, which could no longer he suppresed.for intercourse now andthen with an orchestra and a copany of sigers,if only to hear them play.IIeamedlater thatthe Grand Duke had really bestirred himself in the matter by writing to the king of saxony.but the viwe still prevailed in that quarter that I couldnot be grand an amnesty,but could only hope to receive an act of grace;it being assumed,of course,that I would first have to report myselfe to a magistrate  for examination.thus the fulfilment of my wish remained impossible,and I shrank in dismay before the problem of how to secure a performence ofmy tritan which Icould superintend in person,as I had determined to do I was assured that the Grand Duuke would know what measure to resort to in order to meet the situation
