On occasion, the University enlisted the services of lecturers and distinguished scholars, outside its own resident professors, to speak on subjects to which their studies were directed. During the first few years, lectures occurred more frequently with longer visits than in more recent years. When the University's faculty numbers were smaller, the need for occasional outside lecturers was greater. The University continues to extend guest lecturer invitations to non-resident professors. The Baltimore University's proximity to Washington makes it particularly  convenient to draw educated men from the capital to lecture on their favorite areas of study.  A recent lectureship of poetry was founded by Mr. and Mrs. Turnbull, of Baltimore, in memory of their deceased son. In addition, an annual course is anticipated to be taught by distinguished writers, poets, critics and historians of poetry. New York resident, Mr. E.C. Steadman, will be the first lecturer in this course, followed by Professor Jebb, of Cambridge, England. Mr. Eugene Levering instituted another lectureship promoting the purpose of the Young Men's Christian Association. Rev. Dr. Broadus, of Louisville, KY served as first lecturer in this series. Some of the lecturers made Baltimore their home for long periods of time and could no longer be declared non-resident.
