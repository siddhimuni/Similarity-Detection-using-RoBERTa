But he went even further than this and rewrote the text so that the language became that of the 1400s rather than the 1300s. It was the only way to make it work with his planned sequel, about which he wrote, "I feel inspyred to make after the booke you hold in your handes another, which shall be typesette in this same printer, and of its chapteres and tables have some parte. For some and another reason, I do not wish to put my book next to his." As he states, the next book opens with an empty page, which is followed by a new title. His index is nevertheless combined with the other seven books together in a single alphabet. A more detailed index, where each of the books has a separate alphabet, can be found in the printing of Wynkyn de Worde.

The Polychronicon is one of Caxton's larger works, even laying aside the idea that this "Liber ultimus" was the only work that sprang from his pen a total original, and in his bibliography the Prohemye, he mentions the Polychronicon and Golden Legend as a pair of "notable" histories. More copies of these have survived than those of any other books, possibly due to larger printings. There are over 40 Polychronicons catalogued in the 1909 "Census of Caxtons", while his smaller printings often survive in no more than one copy. On top of these 40 there are another 48 which were sold at auction in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but which he could not connect to a known copy. For example, the copy I am using was purchased in New York in 1868, and one of its previous owners has inscribed their name on its inner cover. It was rebound by the most recent owner in the finest cover available to the Victorians, with a leaf approximating standard letter paper.

Other copies of this work were bound in the same general way, for example a copy purchased in New York in 1876; for this reason the "Census of Caxons" incorrectly conflates the two.
