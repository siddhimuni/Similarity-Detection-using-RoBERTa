She ordered food, and after they had eaten and washed their hands the maid served wine. The lady was accomplished on the dulcimer so she played and sang the following song:

Prosperity and happiness come and go like the tide. So enjoy the good times while you can because they may suddenly disappear.

They spent the rest of the day drinking and enjoying themselves. When evening came the lady went to bed, leaving Sherkan with the young girls. He slept on the ground until he was wakened in the morning by the girls playing the tambourine and other instruments for him. When he got up they took him to his wife. She took his hand and had him sit down and asked him if he had had a good night. Then she played the lute as she sang the following song:

Parting is very unpleasant, even the sun hates to leave at the end of the day.

When she had finished singing there was a lot of shouting and a bunch of men ran in waving swords, yelling in Greek, "We have finally found you Sherkan, and we are here to kill you." He realized then that his wife had set a trap for him. She had threatened him and he had stupidly walked right into it. When he turned to his wife to accuse her he saw that she had gone pale, and she jumped up and said to the men, "Who are you?" The leader answered, "Do you know who this man is?" She answered, "No, who is he?" The leader responded, "He is the son of King Omar ben Ennuman. He destroys fortresses and plunders and ransacks whole cities. He is undefeatable. Your father, King Herdoub, heard of him from the princess Dhat ed Dewahi. You have done a great favor to the Greek army by helping us capture this destructive beast."
