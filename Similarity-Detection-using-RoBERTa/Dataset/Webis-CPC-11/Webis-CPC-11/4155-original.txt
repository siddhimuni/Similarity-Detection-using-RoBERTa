  Res gest√¶ regumque, ducumque, et tristia bella,
  Quo scribi possint numero, monstravit Homerus.--HOR.
  By Homer taught, the modern poet sings,
  In Epic strains, of heroes, wars, and Kings.--FRANCIS.

There are certain forms and etiquettes in life, which, though the neglect of them does not
amount to the commission of a crime, or the violation of a duty, are yet so established by
example, and sanctioned by custom, as to pass into Statutes, equally acknowledged by society,
and almost equally binding to individuals, with the laws of the land, or the precepts of morality.
A man guilty of breaking these, though he cannot be transported for a felon, or indicted for
treasonable practices, is yet, in the High Court of Custom, branded as a flagrant offender
against decorum, as notorious for an unprecedented infringement on propriety.

There is no race of men on whom these laws are more severe than Authors; and no species of
Authors more subject to them, than Periodical Essayists. Homer having prescribed the form,
or to use a more modern phrase, set the fashion of Epic Poems, whoever presumes to deviate
from his plan, must not hope to participate his dignity: And whatever method, The Spectator,
The Guardian, and others, who first adopted this species of writing, have pursued in their
undertaking, is set down as a rule for the conduct of their followers; which, whoever is bold
enough to transgress, is accused of a deviation from the original design, and a breach of established
regulation.

It has hitherto been customary for all Periodical Writers, to take some opportunity, in the
course of their labours, to display their Critical abilities, either by making observations
on some popular Author, and work of known character, or by bringing forth the performances
of hidden merit, and throwing light on genius in obscurity. To the critiques of The Spectator,
Shakespear, and more particularly, Milton, are indebted, for no inconsiderable share of the
reputation, which they now so universally enjoy; and by his means were the ruder graces, and
more simple beauties of Chevy Chace held up to public view, and recommended to general admiration.
