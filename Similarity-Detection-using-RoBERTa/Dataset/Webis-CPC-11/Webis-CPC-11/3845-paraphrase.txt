From the above system, there is no chance for facing many difficulties if you try to reproduce the same work in a bigger size according to Mr. H.P. Kirby or Mr. D.A. Greggâ€™s known theories. Usually a drawing will be reproduced with fine and delicate lines and it can be well promoted to another size if there is no need of much difference in size between the original and the reproduction required.  As a common way, if you are ready to create the plate about two thirds the size of the original, then certainly you can attain the best results.
But as a matter of fact if you draw something on tinted paper by using so many colored inks, it is in fact very difficult to reproduce with more satisfaction.  Especially in these types of works, it is always better to avoid a bluish ink upon a yellow color paper particularly. 
Generally, if you are kind enough to draw anything or to reproduce by the half tone processes, even including line drawings in pen or ink pen,   its originality will be based on the character of its original image only.  If you are ready to draw using water colors, monochrome drawings in wash, pencil drawings and with any combinations of these items will certainly give you the best results.  But such results will be varied from one to another with slightest differences. The same rule also will be applied to line work and also it will give good result to a considerable extent in the present case. But a combination of darkest black ink lines or lighter black inclines with thinned or light grey ink will not be giving better results satisfactorily. The relation between these two dark black and light grey colors is capable to preserve the lighter lines at all.  Even if you are not making darkest the darker portions, it will not be very great in appearance. Usually delicate drawings will be rarely reproduced without giving a background tint all over.  Moreover this type of drawings will commonly ruin the life and snap of the original.
