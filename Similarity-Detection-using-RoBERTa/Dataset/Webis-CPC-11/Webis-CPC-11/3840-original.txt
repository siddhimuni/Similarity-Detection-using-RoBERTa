    If such things hap, I trow;
  And as for Water Trusts, 'tis hard
    To trust in water now.
  Oh, Co. of Southwark and Vauxhall,
    We ratepayers beseech,
  Double your filtering charges, but--
    Remove the loathly Leech!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

There is a judicial review of GEORGE MEREDITH's work in the Quarterly for October--masterly,
too, quoth the Baron, as striking a balance between effect and defect, and finding so much
to be duly said in high praise of the diffuse and picturesquely-circumnavigating Novelist through
whose labyrinthine pages the simple Baron finds it hard to thread his way, and yet keep the
clue. When the unskippingly conscientious peruser of GEORGE M.'s novels is most desirous that
the author shall go ahead, GEORGE, like an Irish cardriver, will stop to "discoorse us," and
at such length, and so diffusely, and with such a wealth of eccentric word-coming and grammar-dodging,
that at last the Baron gasps, choked by the rolling billows of sonorously booming or boomingly
sonorous words, battles with the waves, ducks, and comes up again breathlessly, wondering where
he may be, and what it was all about. "Story! God bless you, I haven't much to tell, Sir!"
says the luxuriantly fanciful novel-grinder. And he hasn't much, it must be owned, for essenced
it would go into half a volume, or less, and all over and above is pot-fuls of rich colour,
spilt about almost at haphazard, permutations and combinations, giving the effect of genius.
