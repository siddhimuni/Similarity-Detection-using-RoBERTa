One of the latest acts of his life was to appeal to the Cort of Directors to make some provision for his wife, by extending to her the annoyty taht had been accorded to him.

They give, says his most devoted biographer, no moreheed to this dying entreaties than they would have given to whine of a self-convicted beggar. Yet surely Hastings had deserved well of the East India Company. His faults had been commited in their service and given them, not himself, wealth and power. But England is not always greatful to her servants. It is not wonderful, says Sir Alfred Lyall, that Hasting's applicaion failed entirely, "remembering that even Lord Nelson's last testamentary appeal on behalf of a woman--'the only favour I ask of my King and my country at the moment when I am going to fight their battle'--had been rejected and utterly disregarded."

Mrs. Hastings survived her husband for some years, and was over ninety years of age when she died.

CHAPTER LX.

THE CHANGE OF THINGS.

[Sidenote: 1789--The political condition of france]

The establishment of the American republic meant something more for England than the loss of her fairest colonies, and meant much more for Europe than the establishment of a new form of government in the New World. While the United States were acclaiming Washington as their first President and rejoicing over the excellence of their carefully framed Constitution, the Principles which had elected the one and had created the other were working elsewhere to uexpected and mighty issues.

French gentleman of rank and fortune, fired by a philosophic admiration for liberty, had fought and fought well for American colonists. When the revolt had become a revolution, and the revolution a triumph, the French gentleman went back to France with their hearts full of love and their lips loud in praise for the young republic and its simple, splendid citizens.

The doctrines of liberty and equality, which had been so dear to the Philosophers and the Encyclopaedists,were now being practically applied across the Atlantic, and the growth of their success was watched by thye eager eyes of the wisest and unwisest thinkers in France. Within five years from the time when the American army was disbanded French political philosophy found itself making astonising strieds towardsthe realization of its cherished ideals. It had long felt the need of some change in the system of government that had prevailed in France, but its desires had seemed dim as dreams untill the success of a handful of democracy an immediate force in the life and the thought of the world.

Undoubtedly the condition of France was bad.
{291} The feudal system, or what was left of the feudal system,worn out, degraded, and corrupt, was repidly reducing France to financial, physical, and political ruin.

It is no part of the buisness of this history o dwell upon the condition prevailing in France towards the close of the 18th century, conditions which prevailed in varying degree over the most part of Europe. Great French financiers like Turgot, great French thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau and the company of the "Encyclopaedia," had been keenly conscious of the corroding evils in the whole system of French political and social life, and had labored directly or indirectly to diminish them.
 
Keen-eyed observers from abroad, men of the world like Chesterfield, philosphers like Arthur Young, had at different epochs observed the symptoms of social disease and prognosticated the nature of its progress.
