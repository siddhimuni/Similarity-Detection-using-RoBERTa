The makers here at Lyons should be given a lot, yet I will hardly give them a sentence or two; not one thing I saw in Paris or London can hold a candle to the brilliance of these velvets, or with the skill and talent needed to create such effects, while one of the sides, the wrong side, is lustrous and not stuck through. The tapestry-like hangings for the bed-chamber of Russia's Empress are beautifully done; the palette bright and the pattern regal: A screen for the Grand Signor is well executed here; he would most certainly have been happy with radiance in the picking of his furniture, but Mr. Pernon has added a touch to it and thought to place an urn or vase of a deep red velvet away from the foreground of brilliant gold tissue with admirable foresight. 

It is noted that the more regal people get the less they see value in magnificence; distinction being the very good thing which all humans value with more than adequate ability seek. Need must first be given we know, convenience then makes to be agreeable; but as soon as people can find ways after that time to make themselves a leader in taste, they can learn to dislike those poor divisions and distinctions which wealth alone can give.

Speaking of taste leads one to talk of gardening; and having moved yesterday between two villas owned by some of the most affluent merchants in Lyons, I was given the opportunity to see the throwing away of grounds meant for fun and pleasure; where a connection of old elm trees created shade that prevented the radiant sun from inhibiting our view, and made the grass so nice to walk upon that my soul wished for the grace of a lawn and bushes - though I do indeed think laying out a Lancashire man's seat in northern England crazy, where the warmth of the sun should be welcomed and where the lake creates sparkling beams due to the sun's beams, instead of the gurgling of a fountain which can refresh one with the very sound and murmur. It is here where the Rhone river can be taken all the way up to the house, although I see it is reasonable enough to content one's self with a Bird Cage Walk, when we are certain at its termination to find us surrounded by a horizon so large that our eyes will be fully occupied and so wonderfully colored that it will provide little respite. Someone once suggested to me that our island is an emerald among the gems of Europe I have remembered it ever since; for surely France would be determined, through the same scale, as the ruby; this classification coming from the relative lack of grass, vegetation saving for tall forest trees, cut down vineyards supported by white posts, the size of which support carnations in our flower gardens; and these placed near each other by the many hundreds on a slope seems to confused rather than please the passerby, who must wait until he or she remembers the greater quality of their own produce, before he or she takes them over a Herefordshire orchard or a Kentish hop-ground.
