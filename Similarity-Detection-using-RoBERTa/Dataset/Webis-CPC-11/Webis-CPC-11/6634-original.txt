But how am I to get it, without waking its master?" 

 Very quietly he cut four long sticks. 

 One after the other he placed these under each side of Sancho's saddle; then loosening the girths, he gradually raised the sticks till the saddle was clear of the animal's back. 

 Gently, in the moonlight, he led the tired ass away, and Sancho, undisturbed, snored on. 

 When it was broad daylight, the squire awoke, and without opening his eyes, stretched himself. Down fell the sticks; down with a terrible bump fell Sancho. 

 "Body o' me!" he yelled, "where is my ass?" 

 And with many tears he searched high and low, but no ass was then to be found, nor for many months afterwards. 

 And how at last Sancho got back the ass you must read for yourself in the History of Don Quixote. 

 For yourself, too, you must read of Don Quixote's adventures in the mountains; how he there did penance; and of many other things, till at last the Curate and the Barber of La Mancha took him home in a cart which the Knight believed to be an enchanted chariot.

 HOW DON QUIXOTE SAW DULCINEA 

 Now a third time did Don Quixote set off on his search for adventures, and as he and Sancho Panza rode again away from their village, it seemed to Don Quixote that certainly it was his duty as a knight-errant to visit the Mistress of his Heart, the beautiful Dulcinea. 

 It was midnight when they reached Toboso, and the whole town was still, everybody in bed and asleep. 

 "Lead me to her palace, Sancho," said Don Quixote.
