"Now don't be cross. Kissing
is so nice, and you must just give me one, just one, and I'll let you go," overcoming her slight
resistance and smothering that crimson face with kisses. "Now do, or I shall go on kissing
you, dear, it's more than I can help. You are so nice."

"Well then, only a little one," she lisped, just touching my cheek with her lips.

"Ah, no, that isn't a good one. Why I could kiss you all over, if you had no clothes on," as
one of my hands was slipped inside the bosom of her dress, having slyly unfastened one or two
hooks.

"No, no? You shan't, Mr. Percy. What should I do if Phoebe was to come in?"

"But she will be two hours yet, you little goose; how can a kiss or a touch hurt you?"

Her lips met mine, and I took a long, luscious kiss, almost sucking her breath away, and my
hand was in possession of one of the small firm globes of her bosom, still more increasing
her confusion, as I rubbed and played with the rosy nipples and moved my hand from one to the
other little strawberry tips. This could not go on in a standing posture, so I pushed her against
the edge of the bed--kissing and groping till she seemed quite oblivious of what was happening
to her, laying back on the coverlet in a dazed kind of state--and, devil that I was, it took
no time to part her beautiful legs, which I found protected by prettily frilled drawers, which
still hid the charms of her person from my groping fingers. I wanted to look, but was afraid
to withdraw my kissing from her lips, for fear she might recover herself and resist my encroachments
below.

My ardent prick stood like a bar of ivory, impatient for a breach to be opened for his advance
to the assault of her tender virginity. Nervously my fingers pulled at the impeding linen,
till they found a small opening and could touch the downy furniture of her mount, and finding
the entrance to Love's Palace of Pleasure, slowly parted the velvety lips of her maiden slit.
