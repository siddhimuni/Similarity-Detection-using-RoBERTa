The social unreast that characterized the late 1810s was a product both of the poverty and hard living conditions of the working class, and of a general push for reform.  At the time, government leaders had difficulty understanding the causes of this unrest, and they consequently could not grasp the difference between those who were looking for moderate reforms, and those who were more bloodthirsty in their desire for revolution.  Indeed, with the French Revolution and all of its gore still fresh in the minds of many, it is easy to see why the government distrusted even those with less extreme messages. The regency's failure to distinguish between violent and nonviolent reform was partially perpetuated among the reformers themselves; although those with moderate views condemned the extremists among themselves, they saved public renunciation for the government alone.  Riots over the availability and price of bread were totally ineffective, and the cost of wheat continued to rise from 1816 to 1817.  The government held the reform party accountable for many of the social disturbances that took place around this time, such as the destruction of threshing machines (or "rickburning"), riots in coalmining districts where the industry had stagnated, and the resurgance of Luddism. The government was unable to see that although reformers, like the writer Cobbett, did have a hand in creating unrest within institutions, they did not support violent force in the attainment of these aims. Rather, they advocated parlimentary reform as a way to remedy social imbalances.
