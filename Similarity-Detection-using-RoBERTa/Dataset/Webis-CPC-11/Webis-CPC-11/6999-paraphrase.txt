In Boston, Massachusetts, a bill was passed that allowed the city to purchase lands at its own discretion in order to build public parks for people in and around the area.

Although the bill was met tough opposition, the responsibility and judgment of the city (Boston) to use the land as proposed was welcomed by the citizens of the city.

Still, those opposing the bill argued that Bostonians already own areas of the city that meet or exceed park like beauty.  However, how can this be unless we are referring to the hours spent in a vehicle during rush-hour.

Again, non-advocates of the bill suggested that the city would not be able to afford such parks.  This was also countered with the fact that the city has the ability to pay for other public services such as prisons, jails and police services.  Why not public parks?


Stay the course.  We have appointed the right official to drive this bill through and so we believe it in our hearts that this will be a success.

The report has been issued, reviewed and is now awaiting action.  The action is now up to the commission to do the right thing.  We know that not everyone will approve of this bill; however, we must ask ourselves why we would choose to not allow such a privilege to the great citizens and municipal authorities of our city.

The time is now for all of us to represent the people of our city and provide them with what was requested.  

I now bring to you Mr. George B. Chase who will present the resolutions.

I hold in my hands the resolutions that have be so meticulously prepared in order to offer the best interests to this great city.
