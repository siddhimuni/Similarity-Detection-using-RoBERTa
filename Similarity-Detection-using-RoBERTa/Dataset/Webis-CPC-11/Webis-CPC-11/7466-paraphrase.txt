No way. If anything, the military wont give up the country just like that. I mean, what do they have to fear from England? 

There's only one way that Ireland can become a part of the British empire and this is by assisting the government there in thwarting the rebels. 

If Englishmen wish to keep their liberty or even the ability to help their fellow man, despotism must not be tolerated. Britain has had these liberties for the better part of the century, so these despots will surely try to take them away from us. 

Already, thousands have died in this war. Ireland is a veritable blood bath. In spite of this, the rebels have not been broken of their spirits. Unfortunately, because of this, more blood will be shed before peace will come. A military chief has been sent to give surender. And HE may subdue, but will it be the rule of the King to have Ireland? Will our assistance in battle restore valor? 

Will the overthrowing the present Irish mal-government appease the people?

Will the carnage make the enemy more popular? 

Englishmen! Your friends in Ireland need your help now. We are brothers and allies, tied by our nature and our ideals. Each of us, England and Ireland, are entitled to reap the benefits of the constitution, we depend on each other.
