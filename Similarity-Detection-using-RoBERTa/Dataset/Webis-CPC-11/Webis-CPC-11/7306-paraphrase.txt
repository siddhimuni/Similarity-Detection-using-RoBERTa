We don't know about the magnification, but the diminution is most remarkable.

THE EVERLASTING ROMANCE.

I did a dreadful thing the other day: I intruded, instinctively but in the most disastrous way, on a love scene. It took place in the National Gallery which is known as the meeting-place of affinity. The big room where pictures owned by the Duke of WESTMINSTER and the Duke of BUCCLEUCH are hanging now. Suddenly I was standing between two young souls whose sight was fixated upon each other. As one would predict, I moved away, but then returned back and observed them a little, since it was clear that, though not yet a passion it seemed a mutual connection of such depth that an outsider could affect it.
