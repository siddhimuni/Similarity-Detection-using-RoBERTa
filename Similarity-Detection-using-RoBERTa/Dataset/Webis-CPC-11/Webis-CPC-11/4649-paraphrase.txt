"The lives of saints"are not confined to history,
even they embrace what ever is most valuble in history,as they are sacred,ecclesiastical,or profone.This work extends farther,it gives the reader a mass of general information,digestedand arranged with an ability and a candor never surpassed.Here every art and science is noticed.Chronology,criticism,
eloquence,painting,sculpture,architecture--in a
word,whatever has occupied or varied man in {008}
times of barbarism or of civilization;in peace or in war;in the countries which are surround us or far
remote;in these later ages,or in times centuries upon centuries have revolved;all of this are treated
of,not flippantly nor ostentatiously,but with a sobriety and solidity peculiar to the writer of this work.

But there is a quality which can said to be included
"The Lives of the Saints."it is this:that here the
the doctrines of Catholic Church are given to us
passing through the ordeal of time unchanged and
will not change,while her discipline is seen to vary from age to age;like as a city fixed and no moveable,whose walls,ramparts,and out works,undergo,
from one time to other,the required changes,alterations,or repairs.Here are elivated out
the persecutions which the Saints endured,which the --persecutions which patience overcame,which the
power of god subdued.Here looked at the cause of
dissension in church;also gave birth to bad men with prid and passions;the distruction of the wicked,--the saving of innocent,--between truth and error;the triumph,at one time of the city of God,
at other,the temporary exaltation of the empire of
stan.in this work,we see powerful and great leaders of God's people,the pastors and doctors of church,
displaying lights gives them frim heaven,and exercising a courage all-devine;while crowds of the elect are presented to us in every age retiring
from the world,hiding their lives with Christ in Go,and deserving,by their innocence and sancity,
to be recieved into heaven until christ,who was
their life,will again appear,when they also appear
along with him glory.
