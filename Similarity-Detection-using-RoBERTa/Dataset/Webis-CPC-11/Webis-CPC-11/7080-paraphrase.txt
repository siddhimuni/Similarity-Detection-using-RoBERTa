Anyway, when you saw His Majesty Oberon in dress wild moves smoothly through a forest that looked like a forest (and thus left his mind free to listen to it), you can believe all the beautiful things he had to say But when they saw him standing Oberon marked Mr. Barker, as a graven image painted with yellow cheeks and eyebrows red, against a painted symbolic, and that he says he knows that a bank where the wild thyme blows, you know very well that he knows nothing about that, and you do not believe a word of it.
But, out of Shakespeare decently out of the question, I liked the dresses of gold from the fairies greatly, if Puck - a kind of adult-Puck Struwel has bad nerves - was not there, destroying all colors screaming scarlet suit, which went with nothing, except a few eyebrows vermilion. 

I also liked the simple grace of line dances in the green mound (English dances, he notes, and melodies English - non-indigenous). But in the last scene, where the columns are intertwined glance, his movements lacked space. In fact that was the problem along, that, and the relentless light poured at close range in the stage of 12.6 snouts protruding from the ramparts of the dress circle. 

There was no distance, no suggestion of the spirit world, no sense of mystery (except as regards the intentions of Mr. BARKER'S). 

The best scene was the lair of Titania, with its background of shades of freedom very cleverly arranged. As curtains were excellent, but as symbols of a forest I found a bit arbitrary. I do not mind a forest that is indicated, if you lack the foliage, for a couple of trees (in bathtubs, if you like) or even a single tree; But somehow - and the fault is probably mine - the spectacle of hanging curtains do not immediately suggest me the idea of nesting birds.
