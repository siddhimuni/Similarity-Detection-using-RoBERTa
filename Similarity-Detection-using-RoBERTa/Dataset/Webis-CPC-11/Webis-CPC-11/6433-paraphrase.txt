The matter is different,and quite within the reach
of occult science.In this,as in all other cases,their ends are gained when properly directed,and causes produce effects.Of course,the only question is,what are the causes,and how,in their turn,are they to be produced.To lift,as long as may be allowed,the veil from this aspect of Occultism,is the object of the present paper.

We must premise by reminding the reader of two
Theosophic doctrines,constantly included in "lsis"
and in other mystic works--namely,(a)under infinite variations and manifestations is ultimately kosmos,and(b)that the so-called man is a "compound being"--composite not only in the exortic scientific
scence of being a congeries of living so-called material Units,but also in the esortric scence of being a succession of seven types of parts of itself,interblended with each other.To put it with more clarity we might say that the more ethereal forms are but duplicates of the same aspect,within 
the inter-atomic spaces of next grosser lies one each finer.We would have the reader understand that these are no subtleties,no"spiritualities"at all in the Christo-Spiritualistic sence.In the actual men reflected in your mirror are really several men,or several parts of one composite man;each the exact counterpart of the other,but the "atomic conditions"
(want a better word)of each of which are so arranged
that its atoms interpenetrate those of the next "grosser"from.It does not,for our present  need,matter how theTheosophists,Spiritualists,
Buddists,Kabalists,or Vedantists,count,seperate,
classify,arrange or name these men has to the various "elements" of the Kosmos of which he forms
a part.this knowledge,though of vital importance in other respects,no need to explain or discuss now.Nor
does it much more concern us that the scientists deny the existence of such an arrangement,because
their instruments are inadequate to make their senses perceive it.We will simply reply--"get kneer
senses and better instruments,and eventually you will."

The "Elixir of Life." All we have to say is that if
you are anxious to drink itand live a thousand years
or so,you must tske our word for the matter at present,and proceed on the assumption.For esoteric science does not give the faintest possible hope
that the desired end will ever be attained by any other way;on other hand modern,or so-called exact
science--laughs at it.

So then we arrived to the point we determined--litarally,not metaphorically--to crack the outer shell known as the mortal coil or body,and hatch out of it,clothed in our next.The next is not spiritual,but only a ethereal form.After a long training and preparation adapted it for a life in this atmosphere,during which time we have gradually 
made the outward shell to die off through a certain
process(hints of which will be found further on)we have to prepare for this physiological transformation.

How can we do it?the actual visible,material body--Man is placed first,so called;though,in fact,but his outer shell--to deal with.Let us assume
in mind that science teaches us that in about every seven years we change skin as effectually as any serpent; and this so gradually and imperceptibly that,had not science after years of unremitting study and observation assured us of it,no one would have had slightest suspicion of the fact.
