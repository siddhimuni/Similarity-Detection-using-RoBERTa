The Frenchman lingered not, however 'twas obvious that he left with his friends a matter of great interest to them; they talked thoughtfully among themselves, their heads bowed, the wineshop wench being totally disregarded; and when Paradou returned, he found them yet in this frame of mind.

This fellow's yearning never ceased. The steady bombast of the tempest, that he fought for quite some time, had not abated, but it had acerbated, this overwhelming passion. His first facial expression was meant for his wife, a visage full of hope and doubt, annoyance and humility and devotion, that rendered the over-blooming bloke momentarily radiant with beauty.

She reciprocated his glimpse, initially with no sign of recognition, then with a rapidly expanding sense of cold calculation, and, without looking elsewhere, she shut her eyes.

Things occurred to her at that point that Paradou can't have understood even if someone had explained it to him: primarily, the awareness of an educative contrast of the man who held forth on monarchies to the man who owned and managed a wine-shop, the difference between the love she craved and that which she had known for a long time, lashed to it like a sacrifice bound upon the altar. There came upon her, more quickly than the rush of the Rhone, a tsunami of repulsion and repugnance. She had given in to the beast, laying herself lower than that of an animal; and now she was in love with a hero, with ambitions of demigodhood. It was the pain of that opprobius thought that made her close her eyes.
