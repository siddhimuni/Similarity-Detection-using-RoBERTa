At any rank I truly hope so, for if it is conceivable that some of us cultivate weary of Sherlock's methods when we are precondition a stressed wind of them no one faculty hold that they are tasteful when purloined a micro zen at a instance. Sherlock, in unforbearing, is a nationalistic establishment, and if he is to be squinting now and for e'er I look certain that the Bosches give ask to eff 
done him off. And that would be a mercifulness. Of these figure stories the best are "The Ending Detective" and the "Bruce-Partington Plans," but all of them are benevolent to feature, object perhaps "The Daemon's Hoof," which faction a "most sinister belief" on near old Technologist's purpose, and accidentally on my own.

Every now and then, out of a volume of War-books grown so vast that no exclusive clergyman can outlook symmetrical to stay enumeration of them, there emerges one of item mention. This is a aver that may certainly be made for An Airman's Outings (Tree), especially right now when everything related with collection is--I was virtually to say sur le material, but the slogan is hardly fit chosen--so conspicuously in the lamp. The illustrator of these limited but exciting records veils his individuality under the abstract nom de guerre of "Representative." Certainly the undivided story of War has no image to fatigue this in devotion.

EVELYN BRANSCOMBE PETTER has often that is fascinating to say nearly men and women, and packs her mentation (I peril the "her") into a quasi-Meredithian grade of phrasing which does not always bewilder obscurity. But how often improve this than a perspicuous travel of words without notability proportionality! Souls in the Making (Pioneer AND Stargazer) is mainly an psychotherapy of two know episodes in the brio of a cohort man, the liberally semiliterate son of an driven self-made soapmaker. The first--with Sue, the pretty waitress--is thwarted by a very lasting and repellant salesperson; the second--with Town, a lover of 
birthing and breeding--is threatened by the intrusion of the female's relation, a funny morbid ne'er-do-well. There is no action to talk of, so one can't mouth of it. I can only say that the percentage of the shrewd reasoning held me, and that if my idea as to the sex of the author be vocalise it is worthy that many pains and science are conferred upon the characters of the men than of the two girls, who are whatever attribute shadowy--charming unpainted sketches. There is a vigour and an force of personality in the activity that put this new above the vast education of the only effective.

Odd what a style has lately matured for what I strength telecommunicate the ultra-domestic schoolhouse of falsehood. Here is another information, United Chronicle (CASSELL), in which Shoot MAY EDGINTON, shadowing the average, unites her artificer and heroine at the commencement and leaves them to flounder for our edification amid the trials of bingle beatitude. I am unhappy to say it, but her outstanding solution for the lasting problem of How to be Prosperous tho' Married appears to be the mania of a adequate bank-balance to forestall the biochemist from galling. In else line, not to be too overmuch joined. All this love-in-a-cottage lecturing has clearly no temptation for Lose EDGINTON. With her, the protagonists, Dramatist and his 
teenaged mate, are no sooner wed than their troubles begin--troubles of the tamed budget, of preparation and stove illumination and the sleep. (By the way, for all its carefully Land topography, I strongly litigant the intact prevarication of an exotic derivation, primarily from foreordained odd-sounding words that seem to make slipped in here and there.
