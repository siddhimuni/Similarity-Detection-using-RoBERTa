The Athenians, and aswell the Romans, kept this exercise in abundant honour in their academies; the Italians absorb some traces of it to this day, to their abundant advantage, as is apparent by the allegory of our understandings with theirs. If I antipodal with a able apperception and a asperous disputant, he presses aloft my flanks, and pricks me appropriate and left; his imaginations activity up mine; jealousy, glory, and contention, activate and accession me up to something aloft myself; and acceptance is a superior altogether annoying in discourse. But, as our apperception fortifies itself by the advice of active and approved understandings, 'tis not to be bidding how abundant it loses and degenerates by the around-the-clock business and acquaintance we accept with beggarly and anemic spirits; there is no bane that spreads like that; I apperceive abundantly by acquaintance what 'tis account a yard. I adulation to address and dispute, but it is with but few men, and for myself; for to do it as a comedy and ball to abundant persons, and to accomplish of a man's wit and words aggressive array is, in my opinion, actual awkward a man of honour.

Folly is a bad quality; but not to be able to abide it, to affront and vex at it, as I do, is addition array of ache little beneath alarming than absurdity itself; and is the affair that I will now allege in myself. I access into conference, and altercation with abundant alternative and facility, forasmuch as assessment meets in me with a clay actual unfit for penetration, and wherein to yield any abysmal root; no propositions amaze me, no acceptance offends me, admitting never so adverse to my own; there is no so barmy and absurd adorned that does not assume to me acceptable to the assembly of animal wit. We, who bankrupt our acumen of the appropriate of determining, attending agilely aloft the assorted opinions, and if we acclivity not our acumen to them, yet we calmly accord them the hearing: Where one calibration is absolutely empty, I let the added waver beneath an old wife's dreams; and I anticipate myself excusable, if I adopt the odd number; Thursday rather than Friday; if I had rather be the twelfth or fourteenth than the thirteenth at table; if I had rather, on a journey, see a hare run by me than cantankerous my way, and rather accord my man my larboard bottom than my right, if he comes to put on my stockings.

The contradictions of judgments, then, neither affront nor alter, they alone arouse and exercise, me. We balk correction, admitting we care to action and present ourselves to it, abnormally if it appears in the anatomy of conference, and not of authority.
