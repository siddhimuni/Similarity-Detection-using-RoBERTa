          Pwyll the chief ofAnnwvyn and the whole of his family and hosts arose..The story went throughout the land, and all the nobles  heard about it. The nobles came to Pwyll and compelled him  to forsake his wife because of the great crime  she had done. He answered them he cannot put away her just because she had no offspring.  If she is guilty let her get the punishment for it.
         Rhiannon  preferred  punishment rather than contending with the women. So she sent for teachers and the wise men to utter the penance. The penance was that she should remain in the palace until the end of seven years and she should sit everyday near a horseblock and narrate the the story to all those come there. If the visitors allow her she should carry them upon her back to the palace. But this never happened as the visitors won't permit and she spend part of the year thus.
