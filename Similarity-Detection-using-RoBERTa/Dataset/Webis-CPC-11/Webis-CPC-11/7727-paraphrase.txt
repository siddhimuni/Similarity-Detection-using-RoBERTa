Honestly speaking, I am unable to engage in drama and intrigue of Verre d'Eau; if this were the only way open to me, I would pack my bags tomorrow and settle down in a German village; work I will as much as I can, but to sell my wares in this market is impossible to me. Artistic affairs here are in so vile a condition, so rotten, so fit for decay, that only a bold scytheman is needed who knows the right cut. Dearest friend, apart from all the political speculation, I am compelled to say openly that in the soil of the counter-Revolution, no art can grow, nor could it in the present in the soil of the Revolution, unless care is taken--in time. To speak briefly, tomorrow I shall begin to research for an article on the theater of the future for some important, political journal. I promise you that I will put politics to the side as much as possible, and therefore shall not compromise you or anyone else; but as far as art and the theater are concerned, you must, with good grace, allow me to be as red as possible, for a very determined color is the only one that is of use to us. This, I think, is the most prudent course to adopt, and he who advises it for prudential reasons is none other than your representative Belloni. He tells me that here I want as much or even more money as M., or else I must make myself feared. Well, money I have not, but I do have a tremendous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism. Give me your blessing, or, better still, give me your assistance.
