    Holding these views and representing the Government of the
    United States in these important transactions, the Commission
    can not permit the use of its name, nor the name of any of its
    officers or members, in connection with any diploma,
    certificate, or other evidence of award while any part of the
    proceedings rest under adequately supported and uninvestigated
    charges of bribery, attempted bribery, corruption, fraud, or
    misconduct amounting to fraud.

    In view of the position of your company, as announced in your
    letter of November 8, from which quotations are herein made, by
    direction of the Commission, I hereby notify you to refrain from
    using the name of the Commission or of any of its officers or
    members in or connected with any diploma, certificate, or other
    evidence of award for any exhibit or under special rule No. 27,
    until such time as the proposed award shall have been by you
    submitted to the Commission for approval, as provided in section
    6 of the act of Congress and rule 6 of Article XXII of the
    general rules and regulations, which rules we hold to have the
    effect of law until modified or repealed by the consent of the
    Commission.

A formal acknowledgment of the receipt of the foregoing communication was received from the
Exposition Company on November 30, 1904.

No reply has ever been made to the letter or the subject-matter thereof on the merits. The
allegations therein contained of flagrant violation of the rules and regulations in the selection
and organization of the juries are strongly supported by the records and the silence of the
officials of the Exposition Company. The charges of fraud and corruption in connection with
certain awards, referred to in the letter, have never been denied nor explained.

The fact that there was a disagreement between the National Commission and the Exposition Company
regarding awards became known through the public press, and thereupon the files of the Commission
were quickly supplied with letters from exhibitors charging fraud and favoritism, and asking
for information as to the status of the awards in the event of certificates of award being
issued without the approval of the Commission.

The situation was aggravated by the fact that a concern known as "The Official Ribbon Company,"
acting under a concession from the Exposition Company, was disposing of ribbons certifying
over the signatures of the president and the director of exhibits of the Exposition Company
that awards had been made to the holders for the specific exhibits therein named.
