God
knows, I do my best to succeed in the work, but it is like all the other positions I've held.
Somehow or other I don't seem to be able to give satisfaction. While I am on my guard and as
alert as I know how to be against one of the things I've been told not to do, I am just as
sure as sunshine to go and do some other thing which is against the rules. If I don't do something
against the rules, then I forget to do something I was told to do. If I don't forget to do
something I've been told to do, then I am quite likely to make some outlandish mistake that
no one ever thought of framing a rule to fit. The result of it all is that in about another
week or, at the most, two, I'll be out of employment again. I have tried driving a delivery
wagon. I've tried grocery stores. I've tried doing collections. I began once as clerk in a
bank. Immediately after leaving college, I started in as newspaper reporter. I've been a newsboy
on railroad trains. I sold candies and peanuts in a fair ground. I have been night clerk in
a hotel. I've been steward on a steamboat. I've been a shipping clerk in a publishing house,
and I have been fired from every job I have ever had. True enough, I've hated them all, but,
nevertheless; I have tried to do my best in them. Why I cannot succeed with any of them, I
don't know, and yet I have a feeling that somehow, somewhere, sometime, I will find something
to do that I will love, and that I can do well."

"Music," we said, "unquestionably music."

"Do you think I could?" he said wistfully. "Music has been my passion all my life long. It
has been my one joy, my one solace in all my wanderings and all my failures. But I have always
been afraid I would fail also in that, and, if I should, it would break my heart sure. But
if you think I have the talent, then I shall give my whole time, my whole thought, my whole
energy to music hereafter."
