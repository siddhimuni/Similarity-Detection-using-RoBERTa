Traveling back to the city of Venice, we find a prime example of the Gothic style in a knight's tomb found at the chapel at the Church of the Frari, dating to the late 13th or early 14th century. The tomb contains no inscription identifying its inhabitant. A crudely but tenderly carved statue depicts a knight in a coat of chainmail, with only his face and hands laying bare. The effigy rests on top of a sarcophagus that is bracketed to the wall of the chapel. A Gothic arch, painted with a starry field of blue, stretches overhead, capped by the knight's heraldry.

The statue wears a sculpted helmet and shirt of mail, with jointed plate armor on his arms and legs. A close-fitting tunic worn over the chainmail is depicted as cloth with two narrow lines of stitching running over the chest. A dagger lays on the right side of the knight. A longsword, not visible to the observer looking up, is on the left.

At his feet, a greyhound (also depicted on the crest) gazes up at its master. Usually in tombs similar to this one, the face of the effigy is designed to angle towards the observer. In this one, however, the knight faces away, towards the back of the arch. The carver chose this odd configuration so that the knight gazes instead for all eternity on a small carving of Saint Joseph carrying the baby Jesus.
