He had passed out for a while.  When he finally woke up he was tired and hungry.  His will was sapped and he did not care what they would do to him.  The doctor or the old couples coming and goings went unnoticed by him. The lake which he saw out the window by turning his head were to him as his own body just present but unaware.  It was as if it was all a play, a pantomime, a falsehood.  over time his brain became less fuzzy and he began to recall where it had all gone so wrong.  The first clear idea in his head was that the old couple had been kind to him in his misfortune.  Another relization was that the doctor, who had Indian-colored hair, was a man of great skill. and not too fond of him.

The second Sunday Mr. Field as quietly laying looking at the lake from his bed, and his thoughs were serious and not very compacent.  Some of his feelings, which had been stronger than he cared, had recently grown vague and intermittent.  But, new ones had come to fill the void.

Dr. Niedever came to his side and looked him over.  He was silent in his approach.  He turned around and proclaimed "Well, my young fellow... we have pulled you through a pretty hard time."

The way in which he spoke angered Mr Field.  "That is the way of it?  Just to do your duty and get paid?"

"Paid?" laughed the old doctor.  "Of course you will pay and pay it all.  But do you think I did all this for you or your money?  Look, it served you right when you were tossed overboard."

"I suppose he will hang as well as any other." Field replied.

"He won't hang.  There is no evidince against him.  If you had died, your body would never have been found.  A village of men would testify to his good character, and I would have been amongst them.
