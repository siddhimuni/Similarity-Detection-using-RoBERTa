Alongside
of splendid sacrifices, such as those of the kings, presumably offered in accordance with all
the rules of priestly skill, there occur others also of the simplest and most primitive type,
as, for example, those of Saul (1Samuel xiv.35) and Elisha (1Kings xix.2I); both kinds are
proper if only they be dedicated to the proper deity.  Apart from the exilian redaction of
the Book of Kings, which reckons the cultus outside of Jerusalem as heretical, it is nowhere
represented that a sacrifice could be dedicated to the God of Israel, and yet be illegitimate.
Naaman (2Kings v. 17), it is to be supposed, followed his native Syrian ritual, but this does
not in the least impair the acceptability of his offering.  For reasons easily explained, it
is seldom that an occasion arises to describe the ritual, but when such a description is given
it is only with violence that it can be forced into accordance with the formula of the law.
Most striking of all is the procedure of Gideon in Judges vi.19-21, in which it is manifest
that the procedure still usual at Ophrah in the time of the narrator is also set forth.  Gideon
boils a he-goat and bakes in the ashes cakes of unleavened bread, places upon the bread the
flesh in a basket and the broth in a pot, and then the meal thus prepared is burnt in the altar
flame.  It is possible that instances may have also occurred in which the rule of the Pentateuch
is followed, but the important point is that the distinction between legitimate and heretical
is altogether wanting.
