I am sorry to have said that.

RITA (after a pause, hostile): You want to be taken seriously? (She sits down, with a gesture of the hand) What have you to say to me?

FRIEDRICH: Much. Oh, very much. (He also sits down.) But--you are not well to-day?

RITA: Not well? What makes you say so?

FRIEDRICH: Yes, the maid told me.

RITA: The maid? That makes me think you certainly expect to stay here some time. Is that true?

FRIEDRICH: If you would listen I have something to tell you.

RITA: I thought so. (Calling loudly) Bertha! 

BERTHA (enters): My lady?

RITA: Bertha, when the Count comes--now I am really sick.

BERTHA (nods): Very well. (She leaves.)

RITA (calls after her): And where is the coffee? Please bring it.

BERTHA (outside): Immediately.

FRIEDRICH: The--the Count--did you say?

RITA: Yes, quite a fine fellow otherwise, but--would not fit in now. You wanted to talk about serious matters. 

FRIEDRICH: Yes. And I beg of you, Miss Erna----

RITA: Erna?

FRIEDRICH: Erna!

RITA: Oh, well!

FRIEDRICH (continuing): I beg of you; be really and truly serious. Yes? Listen to what I have to say to you. Be assured that it comes from an honest, warm heart. During the years in which I have not seen you, I have grown to be a serious man--perhaps, too serious for my age--but my feelings for you have remained young, quite young. Do you hear me, Erna?

RITA (leaning back in the rocking chair, with a sigh): I hear.

FRIEDRICH: And you know, Erna, how I have always loved you from my earliest youth, yes, even sooner than I myself suspected. You know that, yes?

(Rita is silent and does not look at him.)

FRIEDRICH: When I was still a foolish schoolboy I already called you my wife. You certainly know that now, don't you?

RITA (reserved): Yes, I know it.
