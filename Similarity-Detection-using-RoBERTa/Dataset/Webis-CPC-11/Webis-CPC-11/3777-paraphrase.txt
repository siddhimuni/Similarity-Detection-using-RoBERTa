His Royal Highness dined with me, and certainly the governor. I can tell you one piece of news is that Prince is fully determined, and has made me promise him that he will be at our wedding, and he says he will give to me. His Royal Highness was not yet in a private house to visit, and is determined never to do so unless the case. You know you ever try to bear such a character that can do no discredit to any man to take notice of me. There is no action in my life, but what is honorable, and I am more than happy at the moment on that account, for that would, if possible, or in my power, have no man near Prince which may have the best indictment of morality, as an individual, I love him like a prince, I honor and reverse it. I tell you this story is that in myself, my thoughts on all topics are open for you. We will certainly go to Barbadoes in this island, and when I see it is not possible for me to guess, so much for marrying a sailor. Give my love to Josiah. Heaven bless you and return safely to your most affectionate

"Nelson."

Prince testified for attachment here seems to have been caused not least by the loyalty of Nelson nature than the actual merits of the king's good sailor. It is likely he tried to form itself (business) model on the Commodore's young and better original, it was impossible for him to study. A certain young lieutenant, on behalf of Schomberg, conceiving that he was treated in a prejudicial agenda issued by His Royal Highness on board Pegasus, Nelson applied for a court-martial to inquire into the alleged tax against him.
