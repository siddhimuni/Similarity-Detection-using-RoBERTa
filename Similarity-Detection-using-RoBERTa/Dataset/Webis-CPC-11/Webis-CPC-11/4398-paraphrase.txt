I deeply lament that there ought to be anything in the affair or approach of my Query on this topic to encourage MR. DE MORGAN to respond to it more as if repelling an offence, than supporting in the analysis of an exciting query on a topic with which he is believed to be particularly acquainted. I can comfort him that I had no further purpose in writing ninth numerically instead of literally, or in omitting the vocabulary he has restored in brackets, or in italicizing two words to which I wished my query more predominantly to refer, than that of sparing freedom and avoiding useless recurrence; and in the employ of the word "usage" relatively than "law," of which he also complains, I was perchance excessively inclined by the title of his own dissertation, from which I was quoting. But however I may have erred from precise quotation, it is apparent I did not misconstrue the sense of the course, since MR. DE MORGAN now repeats its essence in these words,-- 

"I cannot make out that the law ever acknowledged a day of twenty-four hours, commencement at any hour excluding midnight." 

This is evidently at direct issue with Ben Jonson, whose introduced phrases, "pleaded nonage," "wardship," "pupillage," &c., seem to strike too much of permissible expertise to approve of the hypothesis of poetic authority. 

But had I not inadvertently met with an appealing corroboration of Ben Jonson's law of usage, or usage of law, I should not have put forth my Query at all, nor assumed to address it to Professor DE MORGAN; my chief cause for so doing being that the significance attaching to discovered substantiation of a forgotten usage in legal computation, must of course be augmented tenfold if it should emerge to have been indefinite to a gentleman of such profound and accredited research into that and kindred subjects. 
In a black
-letter octavo entitled A Concordancie of Yeares, published in and for the year 1615, and consequently about the very time when Ben Jonson was writing, I find the subsequent in chap. xiii.:
 
"The day is of two sorts, ordinary and simulated: the ordinary day is the space of 24 hours, in which time the sun is conceded by the first Mover, from the east into the west, and so round about the world into the east again."
