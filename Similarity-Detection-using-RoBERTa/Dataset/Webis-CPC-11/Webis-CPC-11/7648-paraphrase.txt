Urquhart the Scot translated the 3 books under discussion nearly flawlessly. Motteux the Frenchman in 1694 translated the last 2 books which were upgraded by Ozell. This translation falls short of the great version by Sir Thomas who if given more time would have tackled those last 2 books as well.

The numerous copies of Master Francis Rabelais 5 books transcribed into English are average. Our people like the 3 volumes of 1904 with the illustrations by M. Louis Chalon.
