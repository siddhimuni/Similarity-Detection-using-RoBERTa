The different companies met and passed each other on the public square in perfect silence;
the discipline appeared to be admirable.[41] Not a word was spoken. Necessary orders were given
by means of the whistles. In single file, in death-like stillness, with funeral slowness, they
marched and counter-marched throughout the town. While the column was headed North on one street
it was going South on another. By crossing over in opposite directions the lines were kept
up in almost unbroken continuity. The effect was to create the impression of vast numbers.
This marching and counter-marching was kept up for about two hours, and the Klan departed as
noiselessly as they came. The public were more than ever mystified. Curiosity had not been
satisfied, as it was expected it would be. The efforts of the most curious and cunning to find
out who were Ku Klux failed. One gentleman from the country, a great lover of horses, who claimed
to know every horse in the county, was confident that he would be able to identify the riders
by the horses. With this purpose in view, he remained in town to witness the parade. But, as
we have said, the horses were disguised as well as the riders. Determined not to be baffled,
during a halt of the column he lifted the cover of a horse that was near him--the rider offering
no objection--and recognized his own steed and saddle upon which he had ridden into town. The
town people were on the alert also to see who of the young men of the town would be with the
Ku Klux. All of them, almost without exception, were marked, mingling freely and conspicuously
with the spectators. Those of them who were members of the Klan did not go into the parade.

This demonstration had the effect for which it was designed. Perhaps the greatest illusion
produced by it was in regard to the numbers participating in it. Reputable citizens--men of
cool and accurate judgment--were confident that the number was not less than three thousand.
