The biggest  and well known system on the obvious surface. 

Zuchius.  An extraordinary ray-system, but this could be seen clearly only at the time of propitious release of gases.

Bailly. N. in the centre of this  huge area enclosed are two very eminently highlighted streaks.

Schickard. Four remarkable light spots, presumably craters, on the S.E.

Byrgius A. A shining ray-centre, with almost all the rays enclining towards the east from a nimbus.

Hainzel.  There are numerous shining spots E. of this structure.

Mersenius C. Two to three light rays manifest from a point on the W. rampart.

Mersenius C. A bright highlighted area surrounding the crater with short rays.

Grimaldi. This is highlighted by three shining spots on the W. wall.

Damoiseau. A bright enhanced area surrounding the crater W. of Damoiseau, E. Lon. 58deg., S. lat. 6 deg.

Flamsteed C. A highlighted light spread area around the crater on a dark surface.

Brita. A shining light surround area around the crater.

Landsberg.E of Landsberg are four bright lighted areas surrounding craters, structuring with Landsberg A (in the Second Quadrant) an exciting group.

Lohrmann A. A bright area around the crater, with a shine area covering a few miles N. of it. S. lat.1 deg, E. long. 61 deg.

Euclides. Has a prominent nimbus with visible rays, a confirmative example.

Guerike.  This has a crater along with nimbus, in the W. of this, in E. long.12 deg., S. lat.11 deg. 5 min.

Parry.  A remarkably highlighted shining  light-spot in the S. wall.

Parry A.  Enclosed by a shining himbus.

Alpetragius B. A brightly prominent light enclosing the crater, one of the most extraordinary type on the moon.

Alpetragius d (E. long.11 deg., S. lat. 13 deg. 8 min). A shining spot  found by Madler and reamarked as crater, but which as Schmidt saw in 1868, has changed the explanation to this.

Mosting C. A shining light surround area around the crater.

Lalande.  It consists of a huge nimbus and has prominenet rays.

Hell.  A huge badly eminent spot in E. long. 4 deg., S. lat. 33 deg.  This is most likely the area of the white cloud noticed by Cassini.

Mercator.  There is a highly illuminated crater and light area under E. wall.

FOURTH QUADRANT.

Stevinus a. A crater E. of Stevinus, it consists of a central area having widely streached rays.

Furnerius A.  Extraordinary illuminated area surrounded, with shining lines , radiating for a longer distance N. and S.

Messier A. The famous "comet" rays, spreading E. of this.

Langrenus.  Consists of huge but very light ray-system.  It is well noticed under a diminishing light or evening sun.  Three long light rays spread to the E. from the roots of the glacis of the E.E. wall.

Censorinus. An extraordinarily illuminated crater with low light rays.

Theophilus.  The central projected area is slightly enhanced by light.

Madler.  This ring-plain and the surrounding areas on the N. and N.W., contain numerous shining areas and light lines that are strange.

Almanon.  In the center between this and Argelander is found a highly illuminated small crater.

Beaumont. Inbetween this and Cyrillus  are present three significant craters with nimbi.

Cyrillus A. An extra-ordinary highlighted area around the crater.

Alfraganus. An illuminated area around the crater with rays.
