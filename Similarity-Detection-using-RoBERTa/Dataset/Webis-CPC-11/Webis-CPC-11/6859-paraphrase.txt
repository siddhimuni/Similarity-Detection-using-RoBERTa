Lost opportunities are a cause for pity. The Scotch language isn't full of witty openings.

Done deal. Second Reading Shop Hours' Bill carried. Scotch joke, while a rarity, was hopelessly lost.

Thursday- Middleton presented London Fog to the Lords again tonight. The MARKISS was asked if he would object the appointment of Joint Committee to ask about the matter. The MARKISS has great literary dexterity, he suits his conversation to the topic. He waffled on the reply, wouldn't give a straight yes or no; instead he spoke on the subject of Joint Committees, that he didn't know how they were going to be appointed. He hinted that a rupture with the Commons was likely if the proposal was made, finished off by saying that if the Motion for the Committee were put through, he would do his best to convince the Lordships to accept it.

In the Gallery, strangers were confused by this speech.

But it was no surprise to the Lords. STRATHEDEN and CAMPBELL were sharing looks, and both Lords simpered to MARKISS'S diplomacy. They recognized deep design in his speech, and admired well placed hesitation.

MARKISS, it's rumoured, is frustrated with me for letting the proverbial cat out of the bag last week.

But it's no secret. The Government have decided to get out of town on the London Fog. This Joint Committee will be appointed with very little delay. Furthermore, a measure based on it's Report will pass both Houses, and everything will be prepared for the return of the so-called Fog Fiend next winter.

The MARKISS had the following to say of the incident: "Sorry you mentioned it prematurely, TOBY. but you only forestalled the announcement by a few days. It's been in my mind for months" He went on to say "The cry of Separation is growing a little shrill" and finished by reminding us that Free Education hasn't done anyone any good, and Small Holdings not much better.
