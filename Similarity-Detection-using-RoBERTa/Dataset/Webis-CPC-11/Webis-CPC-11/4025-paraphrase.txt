The malarious or marsh toxin, which in our bleak latitudes creates universal ague, in the warmer, remittent feverishness, and in unfavourable southerly localities of Europe, (such as those of choked with population townships, where the heat has been progressively for some time of an intertropical degree)--true yellow feverishness, which is nothing less than the utmost level of malarious disease; but this has not ever happened in European townships, if not as long as the driest seasons--seasons truly blighted by drought, when sultry withering land winds have demolished covering vegetation, and as in the locality of Gibraltar, have left the low-lying stranded, and leeward township to corrupt without perflation or ventilation amidst its own amassed exhalations. I recognise not how I can better demonstrate the circumstances of Gibraltar in these pestiferous times of the year, than by a quotation from a report of my own on the Island of Guadaloupe, in the year 1816, which, though typed without any probable source to the query at subject, has become more apposite than any kind other I could advance; "all standard currents of airstream have the effect of dispersing malaria; when this purifying effect is with-held, either through the contributing elements of time of the year, or when it not able to be made to remove the land on account of the intervention of high mountains, the extra subjects are most fatal. The leeward shorelines of Guadaloupe, for a course of close to 30 miles, under the shield of a very precipitous ridge of volcanic outcrops, not ever sensed the open ocean breeze, neither any breeze but the after dark land-wind from the mountains; and though the loam, which I have often appraised, is a surprisingly open, dry and wholesome one, being mostly sand and gravel, utterly, and positively without marsh, in the most hazardous positions, it is inconceivably pestiferous right through the total tract, and in no position more so than the bare sandy seashore close to the high-water mark. The colour sheltering population only ever endeavour to dwell it; and when they observe unfamiliar persons tarrying on the shoreline after nightfall, they not ever bungle to caution them of their danger.
