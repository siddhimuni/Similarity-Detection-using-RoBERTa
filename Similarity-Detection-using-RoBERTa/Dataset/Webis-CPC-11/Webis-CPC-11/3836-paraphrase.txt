This was not, even so, its soonest facade, as it is encountered in a quarto one bearing day of the year 1707, issued by the Queen's printers, Charles Bill and the Executrix of Thomas Newcomb. It takes position straight away before the Articles, and is basically authorised, "At the healing."

N.E.R. (a Subscriber.)

[Prayers at the Healing may be encountered in Sparrow's Collection of Articles, Injunctions, Canons, &c., p. 223. 4to. 1661. The Loyal Dales Volunteers were surnamed "The Haver-cake Lads." Previously to observing the Note of G.M., I supposed the "aver" to be deduced from "avena" (Lat.), "avoine" (Fr.). What list of remarks delineates "aver" (French) as denoting the annual store or generate of a farm?

D.2.

E.M., in his Note on J. MN.'s statements on hogs, mentions that the time span aver, averium, is still employed in Guernsey. Is not this remark intimately bound with the Eber of the German JÃ¤gers?

E.H.K.

Pilgarlic (Vol. ii., p. 393.).--Sir John Denham spelt this remark Peel-garlick--it may be encountered in one of his Directions to a Painter--but the way in which it becomes noticeable is scarcely fit for quotation. The George of the couplet cited to was Albemarle, who had been injured as long as the conflict in the part of his someone which Hudibras alludes to when he advises us that one wound there

"hurts award more Than 20 injuries arranged on before."

Denham looks like to evaluate Albemarle's injured buttocks to a peeled onion! The resemblance (to Denham) would account for his use of the remark in this instance; but it is beautiful noticeable that the remark was not coined by him.
