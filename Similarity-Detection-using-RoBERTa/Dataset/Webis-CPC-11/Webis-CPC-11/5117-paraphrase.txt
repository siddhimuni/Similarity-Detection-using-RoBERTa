If the lists of genera appended hereto be perused, it bequeath be mechanical that halfway all the cases transpire in genera where the inflorescence is simply
 separated from the other branches of the emanate. In carry rate, then, to the rate in which one region of the pivot or certain branches of a insert are devoted to the formation of flower-buds to the exception of bodkin
-buds, is the frequency with which those flowers become mannered with floral prolification.
Flowers produced upon indefinite inflorescences are answerable to be mannered with either rub of prolification other
 frequently than those borne upon definite inflorescences. Prolification in both varieties is also other
 frequently met with in branched inflorescences than in those in which the flowers are sessile; but the rate of branching seems less cloth, inasmuch as this malformation is other
 commonly recorded as occurring in racemes than in the other
 branched panicles, &c. From the twin
 arrest of lump in skein, in the occurrence
 of the flower, to that which occurs in the emanate in the occurrence
 of definite inflorescence, it might attain

 been expected that axillary prolification would be other
 frequent in plants having a cymose arrangement of their flowers than in those whose inflorescence is indefinite; such, however, is not the occurrence
. The ground for this may be sought for in the lengthening of the floral pivot, so common in prolified flowers--a condition the paradox
 of that which happens in the occurrence
 of definite inflorescence.

Median prolification occurs frequently in coupled
 flowers; the axillary variety, on the other hand, is most common in flowers whose sideward organs attain

 notional
 other
 or less of the condition of leaves. The other coincident changes are alluded to elsewhere or do not panoply useful points of comparison, and may therefore be passed over.

=Prolification of the inflorescence.=--This consists in the formation of bodkin
-buds or of an undue cipher of flower-buds on the inflorescence. It must be distinguished from virescence, or the mere raw flush of the floral organs, and from chloranthy, in which all or the greater share of the parts of the flower are replaced by leaves. Prolification is, in detail
, a formation of supernumerary buds, leafy or floral, as the occurrence
 may be, these buds being sessile or stalked, the ordinary buds being not necessarily changed. Prolification of the inflorescence, like the other varieties, admits of subdivision, not only according to the foliar or floral temper of the germinate, but according to its point, terminal or median and sideward.

Terminal prolification of the inflorescence, whether leafy or floral, is scant
 to be looked upon in the brighten of a malformation[105] seeing that a twin
 condition is so commonly met with normally, as in Epacris, Metrosideros, Bromelia, Eucomis, &c., wherein the leafy pivot projects beyond the inflorescence decorous; or as in Primula imperialis, in which insert, as also in luxuriant forms of P. sinensis, tier after tier of flowers are placed in queue above the primary umbel. Nevertheless, when we meet with such conditions in plants which, underneath ordinary point, do not exhibit them, we must consider them as coming underneath the field of teratology.

=Median foliar prolification of the inflorescence= is frequently met with in Conifer√¶, and has of belated attracted unwonted accent from the researches of Caspary, Baillon, and others, on the morphology of these plants. The scales and bracts of the cone in these deviant specimens frequently afford transitional forms of the greatest value in enabling morphologists to realize
 the genuine temper of the floral cloth. It would be irrelevant here to log into this text; suffice it merely to say that an assessment of uncommonly
 numerous specimens of this cordial, in the common larch and in Cryptomeria Japonica, has enabled me to verify halfway the flawless
 of Caspary's observations. A twin
 preservation of the pivot occurred in some of the male catkins of Castanea vesca, each of which had a tuft of dry
 leaves at their extremity. In the common marigold and in Lotus corniculatus I attain

 also mechanical instances of this cordial. Kirschleger[106] describes a tuft of leaves as occurring on the apex of the flowering spike after the gestation of the fruit in Plantago, and a twin
 lump frequently takes identify in the common wallflower, in Antirrhinum majus, &c. In cases where a renewal of lump in the pivot of inflorescence has taken identify after the maturation of the fruit, the French botanists use the denominate
 recrudescence, but the lump in interrogate by no method always occurs after the maturation of the fruit, but frequently before.
