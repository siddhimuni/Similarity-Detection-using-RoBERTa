The main man of this travesty under observation
is portrayed as "a wild-headed gentleman,"
and revealed as a wretched rascal. As much 
may be said of the execrable derelict who fills
a similar part in a nobley written play published
36 years earlier for the first time as Heywood's
by the keen study and diligent intuition of Mr.
Fleay. The identical passages cited by him 
from the widely farcial underplots are highly
suggestive, if not proven, identity of authorship. But the leading character who
is so alike in both writings must, regrettably, submitted for evidence of the atrocity. The
abuse of simple foreign words or syllables by comparison with indecent original ones is a simple and child-like sort of jest for which Master Hey wood, if charged as even more deserving of the slap than any boy of his age, might have pleaded the example of the captain of the school, and protested that his boldness, if no less out of place, were more amusing and less forced than Master Shakespeare's. As for the other person of Webster's famous triad, it must be said that the most indulgent sentence passed on Master Dekker could hardly in justice be less than Orbilian or Draconic. Alas, he was apparently, if not assuredly almost as incapable as Shakespeare of presenting the most terrible of murderers as a wrong but pardonable transgressor, not unfit to be taken back with open arms by the wife he has attempted, after a series of the most hideous and rotton indignations, to kill by poison.
