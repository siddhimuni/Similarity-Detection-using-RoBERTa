The reason why Italy and not Africa was chosen as the recruiting ground
is probably to be found in the lack of confidence which the Romans felt even in those Numidians
who professed a friendly attitude; otherwise cheapness and even efficiency might seem to have
dictated the choice of native contingents, although it is possible that, as a defensive force,
the tactical solidarity of the Italians gave them an advantage even over the Numidian horse.
The Latins and Italian allies had furnished the troopers that had lately landed on African
soil,[1138] perhaps not at the port of Utica, but at some harbour on the west, for the time
consumed by Marius in the march to his present position, even had not his campaign been planned
in winter quarters, would have given him an opportunity to send notice of his whereabouts to
the leader of the auxiliary force. This leader was Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had spent nearly
the whole of the first year of his quaestorship in beating up on Italian soil the troops of
horsemen which he now led into the camp. In comparison with the arrival of the force that of
the quaestor was as nothing; yet the advent of such a subordinate was always a matter of interest
to a general. Tradition had determined that the ties between a commander and his quaestor should
be peculiarly close; the superior was responsible for every act of the minor official whom
the chance of the lot might thrust upon him; if his subordinate were capable, he was the chosen
delegate for every delicate operation in finance, diplomacy, jurisdiction, or even war: if
he were incapable, he might be dismissed,[1139] but could not be neglected, for he was besides
the general the only man in the province holding the position of a magistrate, and was in titular
rank superior even to the oldest and most distinguished of the legates.[1140] It was a matter
of chance whether a government or a campaign was to be helped or hindered by the arrival of
a new quaestor; and Marius, when he first heard of the man whom destiny had brought to his
side, was inclined to be sceptical as to the amount of assistance which was promised by the
new appointment.[1141] Apart from a remarkable personal appearance--an impression due to the
keen blueness of the eyes, the clear pallor of the face, the sudden flush that spread at moments
over the cheeks as though the vigour of the mind could be seen pulsing beneath the delicate
skin[1142]--there was little to recommend Sulla to the mind of a hard and stern man engaged
in an arduous and disappointing task. The new lieutenant had no military experience, he was
the scion of a ruined patrician family, and, if the gossip of Rome were true, his previous
life suggested the light-hearted adventurer rather than the student of politics or war. In
his early youth he seemed destined to continue the later traditions of his family--those of
an unaspiring temper or a careless indolence, which had allowed the consulship to become extinct
in the annals of the race and had been long content with the minor prize of the praetorship.
Even this honour had been beyond the reach of the father of Sulla; the hereditary claim to
office had been completely broken, and the family fortune had sunk so low that there seemed
little chance of the renewal of this claim. The present bearer of the name, the elder son of
the house, had lived in hired rooms, and such slender means as he could command seemed to be
employed in gratifying a passion for the stage.[1143] Yet this taste was but one expression
of a genuine thirst for culture;[1144] and, whatever the opinion of men might be, this youth
whose most strenuous endeavours were strangely mingled with a careless geniality and an appetite
that never dulled for the pleasures of the senses and the flesh, had a wonderful faculty for
winning the love of women. His father had made a second marriage with a lady of considerable
means; and the affection of the step-mother, who seems to have been herself childless, was
soon centred on her husband's elder son.[1145] At her death he was found to be her heir, and
the fortune thus acquired was added to or increased by another that had also come by way of
legacy from a woman.
