(IT WAS FROM THE CONTINUATION OF "THE INDICATOR,"BY LEIGH HUNT)
IT HAS TO BE THOUGHT THAT FOR ALL ANIMATED CREATION THE BEES ACTS AS THE MARVELLOUS MORAL LIKENESS TO MAN NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR WORK ON THEIR OWN  AND THEY UP STORES AND THEY LIVE ALONG WITH THEIR COMMUNITY BUT THEY ARE HANDLING A FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND MONARCHY.VIRGIL GAVE AN IMMORTAL EXPERIENCE TO THEM AFTER A HUMAN FASHION.HE WAS A WRITER DURING THE TIME OF ELIZEBETH,IT WAS PROBABLY OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO THE VIRGIN QUEEN WHICH RENDED THEM DRAMATIS PERSONAE,AND GAVE WHOLE OPPOURTUNITY TO THEMSELVES.ABOVE ALL THEY HAVE BEEN HELD UP TO US , NOT ONLY AS A LIKENESS BUT AS A GREAT MORAL LESSON," BUT NOT MERELY WITH REGARD TO THE DUTIES OF OCCUPATION BUT IT WAS ACCORDING TO THE FORM OF POLIETY.A MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT IT WAS A NATURE THING TO MAN BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSTINCT OF THE NATURE THAT ALL THE BEES ARE HAVING THOSE FACILITIES.

IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THIS ARGUMENT BUT NOT AFFECTING THE RIGHT AND TITLE OF THE SOVEREIGN LORD KING WILLIAM THE FOURTH (HE WAS VERY LOYAL WE HOPE THAT GOD WILL PRESERVE GOOD)BUT IT WAS FOR HIS OWN SAKE AT THE TIME FOR A LITTLE COLLATERAL DEDUCTIONS AND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE CAN NOT ABLE TO SAY ACCURATELY BUT WE CAN ABLE TO REMARK HOW THE ANIMAL CREATIONS ARE TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY WITH THE REFERENCE ALONG WITH THE MORAL EXAMPLE.WE CAN ABLE TO DEGRADE OR EXALT THEM A LESSONS WE DESIRE TO INCULCATE.IF WE REBUKE A DRUNKENED OR A SENSUALIST WE THINK WE ARE NOT SEVERE TO HIM AND ALSO WE RECOMMEMED HIM NOT TO MAKE A BEAST OF HIMSELF IT WAS  A MOST UNFAIRABLE WORDS TOWARDS THE BEAST THEY ARE NOT A DRUNKEN AND THEY BEHAVE THEMSELVES AS A NATURE INTENDED.A HORSE HAS NO SUCH A HABIT OF DRINKING.THE STAG DOES NOT GO REELING HOME TO HIS WIVES .ON OTHER  VIEW WE ARE DESIED TO BE AS FAITHFUL AS DOG AND SUCH BOLD AS A LION AS TENDER AS A DOVE THOSE QUALITIES ARE NOT BE FOUND AMONG OURSELVES .BUT NOW THE BEE IS OUR ARGUMENTAL TOPIC.OUR TOPIC IS ABOUT THE HONEY BEE IT WAS PREETY BUSY ON ITS WORK IT DOESN'T LAY UP STORES BUT THE ONLY THING IS HE IS NOT SOCIAL TO ALL.HE DOES'NT HAVE ANY COMMUNITY ALONG WITH THOSE THE MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BE INSTIC AS A HONEY BEE.THOSE CHARACTERS ARE FITTED FOR MAN.


WHILE WE ANSWERING THE SPRIT OF THE QUESTION WE SHALL NOT STOP TO INCURE HOW LONG IT IS RIGHT TO THE LETTER OR HOW MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF POLIETY ARE VISIBLE AMONG DIFFERENT ANIMALS LIKE CROWS,BEAVERS ETC.BUT A HUMAN IS GOING FOR EXAMPLE OF HIMSELF IS NOTHING,AT LAST WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BEE IS THE WISEST ANIMAL OF ALL
