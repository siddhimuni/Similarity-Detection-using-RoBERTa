Because his spouse is considered an unimportant sparrow, he must take on the majority of the dangers that birds encounter in the nest. It is thought that the female of the species evolved to create this resemblance, in order to keep her children from harm.

NIGHTHAWKS

The nighthawk, Chordeiles minor, is frequently mistaken for the smaller Caprimulgus vociferus. Beginning in April it flies north to North America, where it is also known as the Mosquito Hawk or Bullbat. In August it returns to the West Indies, southern hemisphere, and by October it disappears entirely from the United States. According to Major Bendire, this migration gives it a range that extends throughout the Americas.

Although Chordeiles minor is commonly called the nighthawk, it is not in fact nocturnal. It flies on both sunny and cloudy days, reserving its hunting times for the latter. During the new moon, it returns to its nest deep in the woods after sunset. When the moon is full and visible, it will continue flying until well towards midnight.

One observer notes of the nighthawk, "This is one of the most beautiful birds I have come to see. At first it will glide like a craft without any wing-movement, but in the blink of an eye it begins flapping its wings quickly like a falcon. When it catches the eye of an insect, it can propel itself straight upwards, as if shot from a bow. Its tail can grow in size to assist these twists and turns."
