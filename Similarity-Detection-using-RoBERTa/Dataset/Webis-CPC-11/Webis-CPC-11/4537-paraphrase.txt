In his youth, he was a good looking lad but as he grew older, he was lost some of his handsome good looks but was still tall, with a fine figure and graceful bearing. While he was in Eton and later in Oxford, he assiduously cultivated the friendship of those who were well placed in society. He did not care to associate with those who were without any social merit. He was more interested in making friends in high places than getting a good education. Brummel was notorious for his snobbishness and the cutting comments he would make about his hapless victims. He had at this time a fortune amounting to twenty five thousand pounds. He wanted to make a sound investment with it but was reluctant to spend money on books that might give him good advice. One of his youthful and wealthy friend advised that he should enlist in a crack regiment and invest his money in it, enjoying life in high style. 

The Prince Regent had spent most of his thirty two years of life indulging in debauchery and dissipation, in a manner only a prince can keep up. He had gained for himself notoriety in London society which flattered him to his face and gossiped behind his back.

The 10th Hussars of the British army were the best dressed regiment but with the worst morals. Many of the officers in the regiment were from aristocratic families and were close friends to the Prince, a colonel in the regiment. Brummel wanted to become an earl. He achieved his ambition by his audacity, impudent manners, and his dashing appearance. The Prince favored him with his company, if not his friendship
