Obtaining wives by capture is common and fights over women reoccurring. Thus progress has been very slow. It is indeed in interest of the tribes of  Australia that we can trace the change from the early patriarchal conditions to the communal clan.

A special fact of interest is that, descent is traced through the mother in the a lot of of tribes. Among the tribes that we know of the ratio of mother-descent to those with father-descent being the method to trace descent is four to one.

We now want to find the earlier custom. It is generally assumed to be the rule that descent was traced through the mother in all of the cases. Observing the evidence of the Australian tribes points to the opposite. We find that the tribes that use the mother-descent system have advanced further and erected a more developed social organisation than their father-descent counterparts, which, however, could barely be so if they were more primitive in their ways to advance.

In The Primitive Family, Starcke, has drawn attention; he says that the female line arrives after descent through the father has been recognized, he says that it is a later development, which began due to various problems in the primitive family for connections between its members, which helped make necessary sexual regulation work in the maternal clan.

It is hard to tell the significance of customs in the tribes of Australia, but we can see that the tribes that maintain the male line of descent suffer the lowest stage of development, and the rights of marriage between them are not defined clearly enough. Also, the sexual taboos resulting from totem marks, are not as developed either.
