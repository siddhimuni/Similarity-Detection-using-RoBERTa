The Jewish prohibitions against the flesh of unclean
animals, are observed by the Abyssinians. The sinew which shrank, and the eating of which was
prohibited to the Israelite, is also prohibited in Shoa. The Jewish Sabbath is strictly observed.
The Abyssinians are said, by Ludolf, to be the greatest fasters in the world. The Wednesdays
and Fridays are fasts; the forty days before Easter are rigidly observed as a fast; and from
the Thursday preceding Easter till the Sunday, no morsel of meat is to enter the lips, and
the prohibition against drink is equally rigorous. St Michael and the Virgin Mary are venerated
in the highest degree; St Michael as the leader of the hosts of heaven, and the latter as the
chief of all saints, and queen of heaven and earth, and both as the great intercessors of mankind.

Like the Jews of old, the Abyssinians weep and lament on all occasions of death; and the shriek
ascends to the sky, as if the soul could be recalled from the world of spirits. As with the
Jews, the most inferior garments are employed as the weeds of woe; and the skin torn from the
temples, and scarified on the cheeks and breast, proclaims the last extremity of grief. As
the Rabbins believe that angels were the governors of all sublunary things, the Abyssinians
adopt this belief: carrying it even further, they confidently implore their assistance in all
concerns, and invoke and adore them in a higher degree than the Creator. The clergy enjoy the
price of deathbed confession; and the churchyard is sternly denied to all who die without the
rite, or whose relations refuse the fee and the funeral feast. Eight pieces of salt are the
price of wafting a poor man's soul to the place of rest, and the feast for the dead places
him in a state of happiness, according to the cost of the entertainment.
