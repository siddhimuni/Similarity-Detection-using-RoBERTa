A gunner put the longer arm of the quadrant in the gun's bore. By doing so, the bob's line as contrasted to the graduated quarter-circle demonstrated the angle of the gun's elevation.

Adding quadrants to artillery's art brought an entirely new area of expertise for mathematicians, who began to create lengthy, arcane, and carefully hidden tables to guide gunners. Yet the basic principles were easy to grasp: a cannon placed at an elevation of forty-five degrees would be able to fire 10 times further than if its barrel were level at 0 degrees' elevation), so they should mark the quadrant equally in 10 parts. This would mean the range of the gun got to increase by 1/10th on every occasion that they would elevate the gun to the next quadrant's zone. In plain English, the gunner would be able to choose a range by merely raising his gun to the mark that the quandrant indicated.

This was explained in the 1590s by Collado. We experimented with a culverin that fired a 20-pound iron ball. At point-blank the first shot ranged 200 paces. At 45-degree elevation it shot ten times farther, or 2,000 paces.... If the point-blank range is 200 paces, then elevating to the first position, or a tenth part of the quadrant, will gain 180 paces more, and advancing another point will gain so much again. It is the same with the other points up to the elevation of 45 degrees; each one gains the same 180 paces." He admitted that results didn't always match up with this theory. It took quite a few decades before physicists really got a grasp on how the projectile's trajectory was affected by air resistance.
