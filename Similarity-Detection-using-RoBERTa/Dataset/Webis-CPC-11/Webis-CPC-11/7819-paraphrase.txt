Accordingly, within days gone via (for lately years I possess granted it up, as too toilsome a recreation) I performed often at that royal game. In these moments it is none toy at all,--but a wearisome whether seductive science; just as cricket is an artillery war already, and football a most perilous fight, and boating contravenes the athlete's heart, and billiards can alone be performed via a bar-spot businesswoman, and relaxed whist itself has grew into a semi-fraudulent system of open rules and secret signs; however the sincere common-sense old toy of chess has arrive towards be so encumbered with published gates and gambits and else parasitic growths upon the pure house-plant, that I for one possess denied it, as a activity for which life is too short and severe (give me a silliness or a story instead), and one moreover within which any fool well up towards crammed book toys may crow again the wisest of men within an easy, because stereotyped, checkmate. However, within this joint, I remind a low experience which proves that positive ignorance of known gates may occasionally be an advantage; just as the skilled fencer shall be confused via a brave boor rushing within against rules, and via finish encounter unconventionally pinning him straight off. When a youth, just ahead of matriculation, I was a guest at Culham of the nice rector there, a chess-player towards his own thinking indomitable, for nobody of the neighbours could checkmate him: so he idea towards earn rapid profession of a quiet but thoughtful boy-stammerer,--by tempting him at an morning period of the toy towards rob, seemingly for nothing but advantage, a certain knight (his habitual dodge, it appeared) which would possess ensured an ultimate defeat. However, I deteriorated the sporting bid, which began towards nettle my opponent; but when later I rejected towards respond divers goes via the card (as he protested I ought), and finally decimated him towards a positive checkmate, he flew into such an unclerical rage that I would not play again; his "revenge" powers be too terrible.
