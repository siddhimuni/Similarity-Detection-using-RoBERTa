Although in India, there has been a belief in a one's "luck" since early times. Stories such as "The Man who went to seek his Fate" appear be indigenous, as in Europe, they might have seemed exotic, and so attractive. Also, the Servian story of the man who sets out to look for his fate, and the Sicilian story of how poor Caterina is mistreated until she finally finds the hiding place and then propitiates it by cakes (see Notes, p. 263), have a foreign air about them, which does not manifest itself in the Indian tale.

Similarities between the Indian and the Servian versions of the story narrative, especially regarding the questions that the fate-seeker requested, makes it difficult to suppose that they have been made separately, using the same source, as inspiration. They are, to the most extent, copies, being slightly differing from each other. Although, wayfarer's fate is represented in the two stories in different ways.

This is obvious, since we know that the Servian first discovers about his misfortune from a hag, telling him that she has been given to him as his luck by Fate. After that he goes out in search of fate, fate appears forth him in the form of a human. Although in the Indian version of the story, the fates are told to be stones, some of which are standing, while others are lying on the ground, , and the traveller felt that, one of the prostrate stones must belong to him.
