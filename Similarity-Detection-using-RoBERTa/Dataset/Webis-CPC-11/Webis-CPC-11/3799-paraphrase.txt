Make use of tracks as much as possible, regardless of the collar and get vehicles. Good luck! I see in Kroonstad. "

My column altogether numbered about seventeen hundred. The night we arrived at Brandfort commander was happy to see us. He was expecting a surprise attack that night, but nothing happened. Undoubtedly, the news of our arrival came Boers and thought better of it. In our mature in the small Deel Brandfort we met a good many small parties of Boers ranges as we went through, but they gave us any problems except a lot of sniping. We have a good part of the refrain, and reached smaller halls Deel and consistently. There I received my orders to march on the Kroonstad Welgelegen and there, watching the country left the line. As I was in the tent Welgelegen two nights after I received a message from Lord Kitchener to the effect that it has been reported that some five hundred Boers and four weapons were seen moving towards Welgelegen and I was to do everything possible to intercept them, and in any case to go to Kroonstad to act on both sides of the railway line on a front as wide as the numbers at my disposal would allow. We could hear nothing of five hundred Boers and four guns, so after a thorough search we went round the country Welgelegen Kroonstad.

On arrival there I reported to headquarters. Mr. Roberts informed me that next morning to inspect the column at 10 commander in chief came to time.
