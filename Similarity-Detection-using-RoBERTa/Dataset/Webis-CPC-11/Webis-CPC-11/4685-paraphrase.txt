These two ideas of different meanings, were inscribed in one of our daily newspapers, to show his carelessness not only about himself, but also about the opinions of others. These declaration were signed by the name Roederer.


He had collected more than one million two hundred thousand livres in 1789 from his debtors, and he now owns a national property worth seven millions of livres. He has admitted that he has more than three millions livres saved in public funds. He often says that he owes his fortune to Robespierre whose death from the guillotine had paid the price for all, and all his bankers had died the same way after being denouced for their aritocracy. 


Among all my terrible relationships that I could not avoid, Roederer is the worst of them all. He is old, childish, and think that every beautiful talented woman can belong to him. I would have told him exacly how I feel about him, but my upright personality had restricted me. He looks ridiculous in his toupee and he has bad breath. His scent of musk is so strong, one can tell he is near from miles away.


Letter

Paris,September of 1805.

Dear Lord: 

It is with deep regrets that I have to announce you that all effots to capture the Turkish Empire had failed. The French, the russian and the Australian are to blamed for our failure. We were able to conquer, Poland, Italy and even the German Empire, but the jealousy of our enemies had prevented us from reaching this particular goal.


After all the disturbances that had occured in the provinces of Ottoman Porte, resulting from lack of government and its officials, it is surprising indeed, to hear Talleyrand declares, more foreigns political forces should be involved in Constantinople alone, than all the countries of Europe combined together.
