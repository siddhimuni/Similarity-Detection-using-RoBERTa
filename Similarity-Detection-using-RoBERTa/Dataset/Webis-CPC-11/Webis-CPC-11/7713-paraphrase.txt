"Something else is weird about the letter. Why would he write a letter instead of telling you personally?" Alhamid asked.

"Trust. He did not trust me. The fear of myself or someone else finding out that he new our secret."

Alhamid shakes his head in agreement. "I believe you are right."

"What does he think? That we are fools? I laugh at his stupidity. The death of him would be bring a huge investigation, the biggest since the Earth-Luna ship thirty years ago."

"Just the way he was raised, can't expect a few months of training to change him"

St. Simon responds with a frown. "Perhaps he goes against all we believe, what is he tells Tarnhorst?"

"His lie has already been spilled. His freedom wont be thrown away for the loss of precious security. But that anchor, completely mechanized?" Alhamid's grin growing.

St. Simon grins back "I guess im not the teacher i thought i was. For three months everything i have taught him has just drifted away in his head"

"Enough about him. Your blue ticket, you still have it? your way out of here? Or go back to space for a regular six month class and get payed for three months"
