These lessons are quick and the order is varied, but in one single morning or perhaps afternoon there is a baffling number of changes. Years ago the unfortunate principle was laid out in the Code, that fifteen minutes was plenty sufficient time for lessons in an Infant School, and though this is not too closely followed the lessons are short and also numerous, giving an restless character to the work; children seem to swing at a moment's notice from subject to subject without an obvious link or reason: for example, the day's work may start off with the story of a little girl who was sent by train out to the country, then settled at a farm and taken to see a cow and the sow: soon this is discovered to be a reading lesson on words ending in "ow," but after a short time the entire class is told rather suddenly, that one shilling is to be spent at a town shop, and while they are still interested in counting the change, paints are handed out, and the kids are painting bluebells. The entire day is apt to be of this broken character, which surely does not make for training in mental concentration, or for a realization of the wholeness of life. Some teachers continue to aim for correlation, but in a rather half-hearted way: others have completely discarded it due to its strained applications, but nothing very definite has taken its place.

The curriculum which has been given is varied in character, and sometimes involves a "free period." Except for in the Babies' Class the three Rs occupy a prominent place, and kids under six spend a relatively great deal of time in formal subjects, while kids between six and seven, if they're still in the Infant School, are taught how to put down sums on paper, which they could almost always calculate without much help. As soon as a child can read well, and work a good number of sums on paper, he is considered fit for promotion, and the question of whether he understands the method of working such sums or not, isn't considered so important as is accuracy and speed. The test of so-called intelligence for promotion is reading and number, but it is actually the test of convenience, so that large numbers of children may be taught together and brought, against the laws of nature, to a more uniform standard.

This poison of the promotion and uniformity test works its way down through the Infant School: it can be seen when the babies are diverted from their natural activities to learn reading, or when they are "examined": it can be seen when a teacher yields up her "bright" children to fill a few vacant desks, it can be seen in the grind at reading and formal arithmetic of the children under six, when weary and useless hours are spent working against nature, and precious time is then wasted that will never return. Yet we state that we believe that "Children have their youth that they may play," and that "Play is the purest, most spiritual and innocent activity of man at this stage" [childhood].

The lack of any clear goal shows itself in the fluid nature of the term "results"; to some teachers it signifies readiness for promotion, or a piece of work that presents a satisfactory external appearance, such as good writing, neat handwork, an orderly game, and fluent reading. To others it means something a bit deeper, which they discover in some chance remark of a child's that marks the growth of the spirit, or the awakening of the interest of a child whose development is slow, or the quickened power of a child to express; or evidence of independent and unique thought and the power to use it, in some piece of handwork, or appreciation of music or literature. According to the meaning attached to the term "results" so the method of the teacher must vary; but one gets the general impression that in this respect matters are in a transitional stage; the first kind of teacher is always a little doubtful of her ground and a little fearful that she is not quite "up-to-date," while the second class of teacher is sometimes a little shy and hesitant, and not quite sure that she is prepared to account for the rather subtle and intangible outcome of her work.
