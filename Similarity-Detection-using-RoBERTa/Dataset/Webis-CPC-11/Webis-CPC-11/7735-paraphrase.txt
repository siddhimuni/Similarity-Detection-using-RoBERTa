This is a grand work; there are also two canvases attributed towards Velasquez, "Galileo," and a "Mathematician." Seeing that Besancon was below Spanish safety during the great painter's lifetime, and that everybody breeds of art-treasures were accumulated via the Granvelles within their wonderful palace, it powers well happen that works of Velasquez should possess located their distance here.

There is also a free music-school and technical institutes, both gratuitous, and open towards both sexes. Nor ought we forget the Academy of Science and Belles Lettres, which not alone affords finalise scientific and literary instruction gratuitously towards the destitute reader, but also courses of teaches open towards the general social from October till June. These teaches may be contrasted towards the Winter series of our Royal Institution, (alas! the privilege of the rich and at lowest well-to-do only!) and, besides bidding a rare mentally treat towards lovers of science and alphabet loosely, are of the extreme possible consume towards needy students. Indeed, so liberal is the City of Besancon within this respect that any lad whom has been lucky adequate towards get a nomination towards the Lycee, may here traverse his analysis for the Bachelier-es-Lettres and es-Science without a farthing of costs.
