Evariste  never talked about Monsieur de Chassagne for the last two years.  But I know that he could not  forgive him as he is very stubborn.
     " But he is my husband". Said julie
     The poor mother  cried  Fortune  is an aristocrat. That is why Evariste is  so furious about him. 
   "But Mother  do you think that if I ask him to take the necessary steps to save the life of Fortunne won't he agree? If he disagree I may say he is monster."
       "My child Julie.  Your brother is not a monster . He is a honest and good man .But  he will not tell me his opionions and I am not competent enough to understand him. But he only do things according to his principles and what his conscience allows him to do. So do not ask him to rescue Monsieur  from  the punishment."
     " Now I know that you are  aware of the fact that he is a such arrogant ,cruel man who do not have a heart to understand the desperate sister. You like him more than me. I know. When three of us lived together you asked me to set him as a model to copy. You thought of him as a great man .You always blamed me and you do not have a drop of love for me." 
   " But Julie I have been a good mother to you. I have loved and cared for you. I still love you and forgive you But you are the person who cheated me.  I had you taught a trade, but you abondoned you trade and forsook your shop. And you did not marry a person of our choice and ran away with him. But at the same time my son looked after me after you have abondened me.I would have been starved to death if he had not been there." 
  " Do not talk like that mother If you have not turned your face from us  because of his instigation we would have cherished you with all affection. But he is prtenting as he love and care for you.  He is such aperson who cannot love anyone".
