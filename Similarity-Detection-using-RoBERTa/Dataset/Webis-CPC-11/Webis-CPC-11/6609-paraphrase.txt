1 Sam. xx: 3; 1 Kings i: 29.) An appeal to our lord, whether directly or not, in attestation of the truth of a declaration or promise, is an oath. It has been stated, a secret association may exist without an oath. But ther is no proof that any does. The secret order of Odd-fellows have declared that they have no initiatory oath. In the News letter published by the Grand Lodge of the United States, referred to before, the following declaration is made: "No oath, as was once supposed, is administered to the candidate." 
(App. to Proceedings of Grand Lodge, 1859, p. 10.) Yet Grosch, in his Odd-fellows' Manual, speaks of an "appeal to heaven" in the initiation, at least, into one of the degrees.
