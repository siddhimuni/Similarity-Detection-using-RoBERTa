"Wordsworth was a great naturalist in literature, but he was also a great naturalist and idealist idealistic and between the Wordsworth was no opposition: each worked with the other, each serving the other. While Scott, by allying with reality romance, romantic fiction saved from the extravagances and follies fell, Wordsworth special work was to open a path to greater naturalism in art by merging it with perfect truth. "

Criticism has long ceased to Betty Foy's ridiculous, and Harry Gilliam, whose "teeth they chatter, chatter still." sports such as malicious proved too easy for Wordsworth's contemporaries, and yet his essential value of poetry was flawless.

Range of poetry is indeed inexhaustible, and even the greatest poets must suffer some loss of universal pre-eminence. Therefore, I can honestly admit shortcomings of Wordsworth, - that he was lacking in dramatic force and power of characterization, that he was particularly deficient in humor, and therefore the saving grace of self-criticism in ability to occasionally see a ridiculous light, it has little romantic glamor and none of Scott's narrative energy that Shelley's lyrical flights leave him plodding along the highway dust, and that force is unnatural Byron seen by contrasting his passion pale and ineffectual. All this and more can be given freely, and yet his influence on English thought, and especially the poetic thought of his country, he should be named after Shakespeare and Milton. Intellectual value of his work will endure, for leaving aside the more valuable doctrine, which, in excess of that poetry is not didactic, he brought forth a new philosophy of nature and emphasized a distinctly its simple dignity of manhood. - Pelham Edgar.
