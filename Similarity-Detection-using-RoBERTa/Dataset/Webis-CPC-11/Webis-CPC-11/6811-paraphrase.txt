Take the manufacture of cricket-balls,for example. You might not think it a very arduous occupation, but Dr. MACNAMARA assured the house that it required "a high standard of physical fitness", and that leather stitching was as laborious as leather-hunting. It is true that some of the disabled men with characteristic intrepidility are willing to face the risk, but thu Union concerned will not hear of it, and the MINISTER OF LABOUR appears to agree with them.

Even on the Treasury Bench, however, doctors disagree. Dr. ADDISON seems distinctly less inclined than Dr. MACNAMARA to accept the claims of the Trade Unionists at their own valuation. The bricklayers have agreed to admit a few disabled men to their union--bricklaying apparently being a less strenuous occupation than leather-stitching--but exclude other ex-service men unless they have served their apprenticeship as well as their country.

Upon this MINISTER OF HEALTH bluntly observed that the idea that it takes years to train a man to lay a few bricks was in his opinion all nonsense.

Thursday, May 6ht.-- Possibly it was because to-day was originally assigned for the opening of the committee stage of the Home Rule Bill that Members in both Houses drew special attetion to the present state of lawlessness in Ireland. If their idea was to create a hostile "atmosphere" it did not succeed, for, owing to Mr. LONG'S indisposition, the Bill was postponed. Besided, the fact that every day brings news of policemen murdered, barracks burned, tax-collectors assaulted and mail-bags stolen, while to one class of mind it may argue that the present is a most inopportune moment for a great constitutional change, may to another suggest that only such a change will give any hope of improvement.

It is, at any rate, something to know that Irishmen have not in trying circumstances entirely lost their saving grace of humour. Thus the writer of a letter to Lord ASKWITH, describing with much detail a raid for arms, in the course of which his house had been smashed up and he himself threatened with instant death, wound up by saying, "I thought I would jot down these particulars to amuse you."

The commons had a rather depressing sppech from Mr.MCCURDY. His policy had been gradually to remove all food-controls and  leave prices to find their own proper (and, it was hoped, lower) level. But in most cases the result had been disastrous, and the Government had decided that control must continue.

Sir F. BANBURY complained of the conflict of jurisdiction between the departments.

If certainly does seem unfair that the FOOD-CONTROLLER should be blamed because the Board of Trade is "making mutton high."

WANTED--A BOOK SUBSIDY.

Mr.JOHN MURRAY, the famous publisher, has recently given a representative of the Pall Mall Gazette some intersting facts and figures bearing on the impending crisis in the publishing trade. It is a gloomy rectical. men doing less work per hour with the present frty-eight hour week than with the old fifty-one hour week, and agitating for a further reduction of hours; paper rising in prie by leaps and bounds.

"Between the two they are forcing up the price of books to a point when we can only produce at a loss:. In other words, we are threatened with not merely a shortage but an absolute deprivation with many luxuries--encryclopedias and histories and scientific treatises and so forth--but among the necessities of modern life the novel stands only third to the cinema and the jazz.It is possible that in time the first-named may reconcile us to booklessness,but that time is not yet.

What amazes us in Mr. JOHN MURAY'S pessimistic forecast is his failure to recognise and advocate the only and obvious remedy. By the reduction of the Bread Subsidy fifty millions have been made available for the relief of national needs. We do not say that this would be enough, but if carefully laid out in grants to deserving novelists, so as to enable them to co-operate with publishers on lines that would allow a reasonable margin of profit, it might go some way towards averting the appalling calamity which Mr.JOHN MURRAY anticipates.

The Ministry of information is closed, but should be at one reorganises as the Ministry of Fiction, with a staff of no fewer than five hundredclerks, and installed in suitable premisis, the British Museum for choice, thus emancipating the younger generation from the dead hand of archeology
