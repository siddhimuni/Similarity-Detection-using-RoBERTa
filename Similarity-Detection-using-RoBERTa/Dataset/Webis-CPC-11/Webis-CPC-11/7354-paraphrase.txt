Verily, thou hast read of Christ's Apostles wherein they were executed as part of persecutions against Christians partaken by rulers of Persia and other nations. Speak now of who is more deserved of being called martyrs, those, or thy compatriots who die struggling for the secular order and the power invested therein? How multitudinous were the atrocities and methods of murder perpetrated against the Christian faithful!  But it was for naught as the greater the numbers of the slain, the even greater the number of souls newly converted; where one fell, a hundred sprang up.

One day, as preparations were made to put to death a large host, one soul in an audience with the King, said "Our numbers increaseth despite that thou thinkest, they diminish." "How can this be?" cried the King. "Only yesterday," answered the courtier, "thou didst execute so-and-so, and, and behold, two more were subsequently converted; and it has been said that a heavenly messenger visited the confessors bolstering them in their final moments." With this, the King himself converted. In those times, men did not cling so much to their lives. Some were spellbound while still alive; others suffered the loss of their limbs, severed one after another; some were put in with wild animals, and others were burnt in a pyre. This went on for a long time, being the fate of those who confessed Christ as Lord. Such was not to be found in any other religion heretofore; and all such persecutions were tolerated faithfully and even joyfully. The faithful smiled even as he experienced great pain.
