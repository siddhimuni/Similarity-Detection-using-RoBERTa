It was the student's first flight when he, breaking the school's rules, flew outside the limits of the aerodome, no longer able to be seen by those near the sheds.  There was a main road with tramway-lines along it not far from the aerodome.  A tram happened to be passing down the road.  The passengers on the top were shocked and upset when they saw the aeroplane was flying low over a nearby field and was coming straight for them.  The pilot buzzed the plane right over the tram's passengers' heads, disappearing as suddenly as it appeared in the first place.  I am sure you have figured out by now that the daredevil pilot and disobedient pupil were the same; both were on a wild and bumpy flight.  After surveying the countryside, the pilot decided it would be a good idea to make his way back to the aerodome.  The pilot was flying too low, anyways, but when he finally returned to the aerodome, he gunned his plane at the end of the aerodome that was lined with trees.  The crowd saw the novice pilot was not going to take his eye off the target.  The instructor and his circle decided that there was nothing that could save the pilot from himeself and his fate.  The pilot came in closer, and still did not deviate from his path.  There was, however, a path between two of these trees that was just large enough to accomodate an aeroplane.  A skilled pilot, one with many hours under his belt, would never be so stupid as to attempt this stunt.  But this student, a total beginner, pulled it off with such precision that even the most decorated pilot would applaud.  He landed on he aerodome and climbed from his machine as if nothing had happened at all.  I am not going to recall for you what the instructor, approaching the plane that day, had to stay to his student, but that is for the best.
