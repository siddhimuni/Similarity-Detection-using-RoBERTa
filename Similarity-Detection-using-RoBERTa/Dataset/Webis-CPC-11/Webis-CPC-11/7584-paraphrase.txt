The ratio of capital to the column in the amount of surface was very slight. The proportion of segments of the arches, of course, depends on the size of the arch - large segments of the large arches, small segments of small arches. The columns are grouped only around the docks and on both sides of the openings, and finally, the natural development of the column in the Romanesque work went to the attenuation - the latest and greatest work, became thinner in columns, until finally merged into the Gothic pillars of multiple columns. The carving on the arch-moldings is largely geometric, consisting of numerous facets cut into the stone tablets, etc., dogtooth trim called is a very favorite decoration. 
All these carved moldings were collected in color, usually red and green. The Romanesque acanthus has lost much of its force, is flat and heavy on top, around the edge, and scratched with V-cuts, and the vine leaf is preferred by designers. Often the mass of the wall are cut in geometric patterns of the diaper, also played with color. Borders are not large, and circular forms, except in the arches, are rarely used. Romanesque art is a barbarian at best, and has the virtue of custom of the barbarian - a direct attack on the problem at hand and simplicity in the treatment of what is exciting to see. 

XXV. and XXVI. WINDOWS IN THE CHURCH OF ST Teresia, Trani, Italy. 

These two windows have very little to suggest the Byzantine influence in its design.
