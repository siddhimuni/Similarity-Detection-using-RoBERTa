They do a great job creating charaters in the "Song of Roland" also maintaining a good form but not nearly good enough to keep from seeming silly. The description of fighting is excessive yet exciting. And in the part that tells how Oliver ends dying of weariness and wounds, he mistakes Roland and attacks him with a sword. he hs mistaken Roland for a Pagan and the reader shares his guilt. The writter of the characters doesn't bias the reader with praises or criticism. So they are less religiously Christian than people prejudge. LIfe s still respected and used as a moral compass as are courage Patriotism and loyalty. 
This type of song or Nibelungenlied is significant to the admirer of poetic works because of it's symbolism. other epics like the odessy only vaguely have a plot, it is of more consequence in these works to represent a linking of occurrances with a narrative, but they lack a true plot unlike the "Song of Roland" which has a weblike, much more complex series of events. Which events cause the formation of the heroes giving them reasdns to act in a certain way which leads to the next outcome.

Such poetry shows characters in a symbolic way. The symbol is not necessarily representing life itself, but some part of life. Courage, one of our important virtues is used to represent life as it turns from something dark, and hard (wearisome)into an exulted state of being. This virtuous transformation is shared by all epics and is needed in life itself for man to use as a route through his own plot. Epic poetry has been used for a long tune to perform th task of developing human personality. Homer's epics are so loved because they create a symbolism for life itself, and this song goes beyon to create the idea of a moral life which was founded on the virtue of courage.
