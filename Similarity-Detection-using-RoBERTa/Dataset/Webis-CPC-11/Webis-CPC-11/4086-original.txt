COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED                  45

FANEUIL HALL MEETING IN FAVOR OF PUBLIC PARKS.

Pursuant to a call published in all the daily papers, and signed by a large number of prominent
citizens and tax-payers of Boston, a public meeting was convened in Faneuil Hall on the evening
of Wednesday, the 7th of June, 1876, to take action on the recommendations contained in the
Report of the Park Commissioners. The hall was crowded by an intelligent and enthusiastic audience;
and the proceedings as reported verbatim in the columns of the "Boston Morning Journal," were
as follows:--

The meeting was called to order at eight o'clock by Mr. JOHN W. CANDLER, who said,--

GENTLEMEN,--As Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements, I have been requested to call this
meeting to order. It is usually the case, that, when a mass meeting of citizens is to be held,
a great deal of labor has to be performed in preparing for and organizing the meeting. But
I am glad to say, that, on this occasion, the important advantage of having a public almost
entirely in our favor was enjoyed by the Committee. We found a strong and intelligent and deep-seated
sentiment almost unanimous throughout the community, in favor of having the City Government
take prompt and favorable action upon the report of the Park Commissioners. [Applause.] We
found the community earnest and enthusiastic in the desire that a system of parks should be
projected for the city of Boston, to insure the health, and to make certain and positive the
prosperity, of our citizens in the future. The Committee had only to present the call or address
through the press, which some of you have read, to find hundreds ready to indorse it; and the
authorities had only to open wide the doors of Faneuil Hall to have the people throng here,
as they have to-night, to manifest the sentiment which they feel so generally.
