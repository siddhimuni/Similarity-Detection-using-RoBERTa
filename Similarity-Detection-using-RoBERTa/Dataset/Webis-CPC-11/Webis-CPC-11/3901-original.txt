The outcry raised by Mr O'Connell and his supporters against the landlords, on account of the
number of persons "turned out, and left to die by the road-side,"[30] will, we have no doubt,
turn out (if possible) to be more unfounded than even his other assertions. The present Commission
has ample powers to ascertain this fact at least: and we will venture to assert, that not one
instance of starvation will have been proven before it; and that out of the hundreds of thousands
who were reported to have been mercilessly turned adrift to perish at the backs of ditches,
forty-nine fiftieths will be found well and hearty, and in the occupation of those lands from
which they were said to have been expelled. That ejectment-processes were served, and decrees
obtained, which, if followed up and enforced, would have put many persons out of possession,
we do not deny; but nine-tenths of those are compromised by the payment of part of the rent
before the day of trial comes on, and of the decrees obtained, the great majority are never
put in execution. Accurate information on this point can easily be obtained from the sheriffs
and clerks of the peace for the different counties; those officers have been amongst the first
witnesses examined before Lord Devon. We would only ask the public to suspend its judgment,
and those well-meaning but mistaken individuals, who, though they reject Mr O'Connell and the
priests as authorities on most other subjects, take their assertions on this as proven facts,
to reserve their indignation and wrath until the result of this testimony can be known. Ejectment-processes
are the most effective and the cheapest means by which the landlord can enforce the payment
of the rent due, and as such they are generally had recourse to: before they can be acted on,
at least three months must have elapsed after the year's rent (which is the least sum they
can be issued for) has become due.
