The Officer Commanding was expecting a surprise attack from Boers on the night of our arrival at Brandfort. Perhaps the news of our arrival had reached the Boers who aborted the attack realizing that the strength of the garrison had been augmented.
During our advance from Brandfort to Small Deel, except for  sniping by Boers, which was more of a nuisance value, we met no significant opposition. In fact we had many  surrenders from Boers.
At Small Deel, we got our orders to march towards Kroonstad through Welgelegen. We were to make use of the railway line as axis of advance and keep the area left of railway line under surveillance.
Two nights later we reached Welgelegen and had   barely camped when we received a message from Lord Kitchener that approximately 500 Boers and four guns had been reported moving in the direction of Welgelegen. We were ordered to try our best to intercept the Boers column. Further orders were to advance to Kroonstad on as 'broad a front' as the numbers would allow. By now, our column had swelled up to seventeen hundred vehicles and guns. 
Despite a thorough search around Welgelegen, Boers were not located. Thereafter we marched to Kroonstad. The Headquarters was informed of our arrival and we were informed by Lord Roberts that he would be inspecting the column the following day at 10 A.M.  The Commander in Chief arrived on time to inspect.
