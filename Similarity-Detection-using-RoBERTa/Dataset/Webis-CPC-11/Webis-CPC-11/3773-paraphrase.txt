Most part of the book  is consists of letters sent by a prisoner to his mother. As we think these letters are not  sad or disappoining. They are cheerful letters which tells us his books and study, his friendships especially with one of his fellow - captives.All these things makes him happy. This may be to make his mother happy as he is much concerned about her.1n the second volume describes the conditions of Ruhleben   . A letter by Sir Timothy Eden  also whows the conditions of civilian prisoners. From all these every Englishmen can be proud  about how their race can survive the most unfavourable conditions.
       Anyway the title of the novel is not at all suitable for it in my opinion.The peologue of the novel is also not attractive at all. This is done by the grandfather  of jane and john Andrew.But the novel is an amazing one as it narrates an ordinary story in a fantastic style.
