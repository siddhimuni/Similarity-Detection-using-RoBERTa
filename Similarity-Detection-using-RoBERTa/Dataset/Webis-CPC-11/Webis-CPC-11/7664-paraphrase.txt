After Lobau Island was secured, a fair number of bridges were built to connect the left bank with the mainland, and these were protected by big guns. Farther down, similar precautions were instituted. This enabled the French soldiers' rapid passage and extended their eastward reach, bypassing the Aspern-Essling line, and letting them advance to Enzersdorf shielded by their own fortifications, and to coerce the enemy's left flank about to cross, and in that manner, to amass his left wing, which was firmly encamped on the rise posterior to the Russbach, from Markgrafneusiedl to Parbasdorf in the direction of Wagram, where it met with the center. These maneuvers were all complete by the first of July, the day that the Emperor departed Sch√∂nbrunn for Lobau.
