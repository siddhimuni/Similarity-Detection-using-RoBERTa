The fact that they have tried to meet at the hateful situations, is a reason why the white man and the Negro have not got along, rapidly in the South. It is wise enough for sensitive people to find and avoid those points at which they disagree and to meet upon those things on which they have common interests.  Democracy can exist only on such things and not otherwise, since individuals never cease to disagree with one another even on trivial things.

The advocates of this view are of opinion that this is a great country where all of us live together and so it is imperative for us to unite and work for its development.  The Negro should be allowed to educate himself, and to own his land and trade with the white people in the fairest possible way. Men who are indulged in common tasks soon come together. 

The real points which help educate men the worth of their fellows, white or black are buying, and selling, land ownership and common material quests, even though these may not be the highest point of contact.  In the south, there are many instances when some successful Negro farmer, or some worthy Negro blacksmith or some Negro doctor who lead his race, was spoken with high admiration by white men.

It is a wonder how, when once a man, black or white, excels in his job, he easily gets into a democratic relationship with others.  I am reminded of a white citizen from a town in Central Georgia, when asked if he was aware of Tuskegee, he answered that he knew and continued to narrate the situation.  While he was building a hotel and wanted the plastering to be done as he pleased, found short of men who could do this job.  He happened to meet two Negro plasterers at work in a new house of his friend.  After watching them for an hour, he invited them.  They did the plastering job so well and it was at Tuskegee they have learned the skill. They hired a white man to carry mortar for a dollar per day, while they averagely got four dollars a day in wages.
