Yves Le Querdec said “we can understand”.  Usually our fore fathers will not be attempting to disturb men’s state of mind by putting so many miserable questions unnecessarily.  What was the reason for it? But according to my own sense, they were absolutely wrong.  I believe that they were not questioning about something unnecessarily.  With purpose and importance only they had been asking such kind of questions someday or other.  Suppose if they have failed to give proper answer even though they were aware of correct answers, or who were honestly looking for it, they will be by their enemies.  Due to this particular reason only, we are assuring that by the help of good policy and honesty only any person can convey the world all the facts…….  So every thing has been said or they will be said some day.   There is no doubt in it. In fact what the friends of the church tried to hide will be certainly conveyed and revealed by her enemies.  Also they will try to make such disagreement over their discovery.  Besides, such world will be going to the most remote corners and they will be piercing through the deafest ears. So on facing today of the light of truth, we should not be afraid.  But at the same time, we have to fear about the existing darkness of lies and errors.

If you want to exhibit your apologetics by word, the best method is you have to say the whole truth completely. In our mind, we are considering apologetics and history as two intimate sisters and they are devised in a same manner.  "Ne quid falsi audeat, ne quid veri non audeat historia.
