After this we passed through
     a fine campaign country of four hours' ride: we were informed that
     this country was very populous; but our fakeer and guide avoided
     the habitations of men. We now began again to ascend these
     magnificent and truly romantic mountains, and in two hours
     approached partial coverings of snow. Vegetation here diminishes,
     and nothing is now seen but firs, whose tops appear above the snow;
     the cold is here intense; and it is remarkable, that, the pullets'
     eggs that we procured in the campaign country just described, were
     nearly twice the size of those of Europe. Proceeding two hours
76   further, we came to a narrow pass, on the east side of which was an
     inaccessible mountain, almost perpendicular, and entirely covered
     with snow; and on the west, a tremendous precipice, of several
     thousand feet in depth, as if the mountain had been split in two,
     or rent asunder by an earthquake: the path is not more than a foot
     wide, over a solid rock of granite. Here the whole army dismounted,
     and many prostrated in prayer, invoking the Almighty to enable them
     to pass in safety; but, however, notwithstanding all possible
     precaution, two mules missed their footing, and were precipitated
     with their burdens into the yawning abyss. There is no other pass
     but this, and that of Belawin, which is equally dangerous for an
     army; so that the district of Suse, which was formerly a kingdom,
     might be defended by a few men, against an invading army from
     Marocco of several thousands, by taking a judicious position at the
     southern extremity of this narrow path and tremendous precipice,
     which is but a few yards in length. Proceeding northward through,
     this defile, we continued our journey seven hours, (gradually
     descending towards the plains of Fruga, a town of considerable
     extent, distant about fifteen miles from the mountains.) Proceeding
     two hours further, making together nine hours' journey, the army
     pitched their tents, and we encamped on another table-land, on the
     northern declivity of Atlas, at the entrance of an immense
     plantation of olives, about a mile west of a village, called Ait
77   Musie, a most luxuriant and picturesque country.
