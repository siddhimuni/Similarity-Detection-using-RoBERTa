Question of the workforce covered by the order has been recently prepared a study admirably Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics published in December, 1909. The investigation relates to eleven years 1898 - 1908, which occurred two thousand and two strikes. In between those strikes sixty-six employers sought injunctions and injunctions forty-six cases were actually issued. In only nine cases there were contempt proceedings such injunctions, while only two cases of two thousand were there any conviction for contempt of court. In order of eighteen cases have been tried to prevent employees from striking, but only four of them were granted them, and one of them was later dissolved. Seven bills were brought by employees against union interference with their employment, etc., and in three cases, the unions require injunctions against other unions. In one case, a union has introduced a bill against an employer and in one case an employer has requested an injunction against the employers' association. In accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts has been declared illegal for unions to impose fines on those of its members who refused to obey his orders to strike or engage in a boycott.
