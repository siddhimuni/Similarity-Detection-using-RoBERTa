Haven't seen that horse before, but I got my War bonus in it.  It might run well, it's half a dollar's worth for chrissake.  Today everything is at ease; no silly battles to take up good space in my evening print; and the best of all, now the King of Sports can race with all it's worth, no more lamentable detriment of our national horse breeding.  The War is over, and I'm lighthearted for sure.

Noting the rapid progress of Reconstruction in the domain of the Turf makes me content. 

It might be not as much a sunshine as I get here.  Everywhere but here, a large number of people might draw their unemployment donation.  At this place, everyone has an occupation.

The New Jerusalem, it is.  Built in a day, in a hope for Peace.

I wouldn't mind at all if what I met in the end is just an anti-climax.  We let ourselves go, once for all, over the Armistice, and even if there will be plenty of celebrations for us, we shan't forget ourselves again.  I know, there will be bands and buntings, and then we're gonna read the directions in the papers, buying expensive tickets and get to our seats early.  This time, we'll be respectable and inarticulate, just like the present exhibition at the Royal Academy.  Anyway, what are we gonna shout when the pageants go by, like "Vive la Victoire!" or "Viva la Pace!" No, no, we don't have the guts to say anything before somebody else did.

I won't be disappointed.  You all gonna be glad to embrace me, although I know your ways of expressing it is a bit strange, as you all always took everything for granted.

You suppose I was bound to assist at my own celebrations, or I have to content with just reading it when it's all over, when the next day comes; or I won't witness with my very own being the thundering cheers, the wild enthusiasm that swept like a flame through the vast multitudes, and how "the red glare of Skiddaw roused the Cannon (RAWNSLEY) of Carlisle."
