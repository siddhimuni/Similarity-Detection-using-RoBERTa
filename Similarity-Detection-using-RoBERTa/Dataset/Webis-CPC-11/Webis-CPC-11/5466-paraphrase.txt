"It's just for me and my sisters," Bacon said the Master, but "only" means eight in this case. All young women had the fresh cheeks and elbows purple, all dressed in white with auburn hair, more or less, and thus a party and had made this flowering and large family, before the rest of the company began to arrive. The following Meggots three girls came in their flight: Mr. Blades and his niece, 19 in the square: the Captain and Mrs. Struther and Miss Struther: Doctor Toddy two daughters and her mother, but where were the gentlemen? The Mulligan, large and active as it was, it was not enough, among so many beauties. Finally came a neat little quick stroke, and looking into the hallway, I saw a gentleman took off her clogs there, while big lackey Sir Giles Bacon was watching with a certain disdain.

"What should I name statement? Said that, with a nod to Gregory on the stairs.

The Lord of the clogs, said with quiet dignity, -

MR. FREDERICK Minchin.

"Pump Court, Temple," is printed on their cards very small type, and he is a lawyer out of the western circuit. He is in his house in the morning-after "Westminster", as you read on your back door. "Minchin Binks and Reports" are probably known to my legal friends: this is the Minchin in question.

He has a personal fortune of five thousand pounds, is a good son, has a married sister in Harley Street, and Lady Jane Ranville has the best view of him, and says it is an excellent and most highly principled young.

The lady and her daughter arrived just as Mr. Minchin had popped her clogs in the umbrella stand, and the status of that person respected and dignified manner in which the stairs led, the cause of all contempt bred by disappear.

DOOR ballroom.

A hundred strokes follow Frederick Minchin: in half an hour Spoff lords, Pinch, and Clapperton have started their music, and Mulligan, one of the Miss Bacons, dance majestically in the first quadrille.
