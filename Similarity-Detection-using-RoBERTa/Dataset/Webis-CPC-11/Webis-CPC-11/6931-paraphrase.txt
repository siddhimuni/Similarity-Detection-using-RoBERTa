"What did you say?" 

"We gave you some whiskey because you were very cold and not really with it."

"You gave me whiskey out of that black bottle?" 

"Yeah." 

Silence filled the room. 

"Can I have some coffee? I don't think he would mind since he did save my life." 

"Sure. There is some left."

Her dad brought her some coffee in a shiny tin cup. 

It was because of Miss Amy's increasing state of poor health, that she made no comment on the vessel. She lay for a while observing around the cabin with great care. There was no doubt it looked worse in the light of the day, but the orange glowing fire brought out a beautiful tinge of color on the bark floor and thatching. 

Also, it was not as "smelly," as she feared it would be, but instead the spicy aroma of the woods dominated the room. She remembered that it was this smell that always made a greasy, oily picnic tolerable. 

She sat up with her elbows propping her and listen to her father continue confidently, "Perhaps, dear, if you sat up for a few moments you might be able enough to walk down with me to the wagon. It would save time." 

Right at that moment, Amy laid down again. "What are you thinking of, Papa! After this shock, I really don't feel as if I could stand, much less walk. But, of course," with a half hearted resignation, "if you and Mr. Waterhouse supported me, maybe I could crawl a few steps at a time." 

"Not at all, Amy. Of course, this man Tenbrook will carry you down just as he brought you up. Only I was thinking... but there are steps.... they're coming! No! ...only HE." 

The crackling sound in the underbrush was followed by a brief dimming of the open door of the cabin. It was the towering figure of the mountaineer.
