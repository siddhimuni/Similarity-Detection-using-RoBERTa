(1 Samuel 20:3; 1 Kings 1:29.)  An entreaty to God, either personal or through an agent, in corroboration of the verity of a claim or promise, constitutes the swearing of an oath. As already stated, a conspiratorial alliance may be without an oath being sworn. But we are unsure that any such thing has ever existed. Odd-Fellows have maintained that they require no inaugural oaths. In the oration published by the Grand Lodge of the United States, alluded to heretofore, this promulgation is presented: "No oath, as was thought once to be madnatory, is asked of the candidate." (Appendix to Proceedings of the Grand Lodge, 1859, page 10.) Nevertheless, Grosch, in the Odd-Fellow's Manual (which he authored), refers to an "supplication unto Heaven" in the initiation   into at least one of the several degrees of membership.
