Suddenly the fog lifted in my mind as if a curtain had parted, and the characters took their place on the stage...the weathered banners and pennants above the Perugian piazza, the Duomo's deserted facade, a Renaissance 
griffin looking down in watchful bronze. Sunset closes the curtain at Pisano's fountain, dowsing the sparks from a red-lit sky.
