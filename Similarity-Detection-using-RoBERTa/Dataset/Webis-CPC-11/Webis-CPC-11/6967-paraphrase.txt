Before the general mustered out, he was the last man discharged.  On the 13th men were transferred to or ordered to join the Fifth Regiment, if their terms of service did not expire before October 1st.  Bryan, Foglesang, Frank, Hildebrandt, Holtzmer, Iwan, Knopf, Lieber and Troska were all men from Comapny E who were transferred.
Company E become first in rank while at Montgomery, due to a change in Company D.  Company E was the first on the right flank and Company I was on the left in the regimental line.
Joyfully striking their tents for the last time, the regiment finally recieved orders to proceed to Vicksburg, they were weary from all the waiting.  On the 16th they boarded the steamer Coquette, bound for Selma, and reached their destination the following morning.  In Selma, the regiment stayed three days, instead of leaving immediately because of change of opinion regarding the newly transferred recruits.  The transfer order was revoked, returning them to their companies to be mustered out with the main body.
They departed Selma via railroad on the 20th, with Company E broken down with 60 men present, 6 absent and an aggregate of 62.
In the afternoon they reached Demopolis and on a steamboat moved downriver four miles.  Here they continued on the railroad on the west bank, known as McDowell's Landing.  At this point, they camped for the night.  On the following day, they reached Meridian, Mississippi and stayed the night, not moving on until the following day, the 22nd.  On the 22nd, they came to Pearl River, opposite of Jackson.  A gap of more than 30 miles existed in the railroad communication, due to the destruction of the bridge over this stream as well as over the Big Black, so the area had to be traveled in the best possible way.
