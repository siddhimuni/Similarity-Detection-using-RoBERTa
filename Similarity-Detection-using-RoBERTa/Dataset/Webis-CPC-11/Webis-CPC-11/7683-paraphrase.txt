Stage 2, returning to nature – Diderot, d’Holbch and the materialists. – Theory of living matter and organization without creation. – Instinct and morals in animal and the proper understanding of self-interest.

Now we begin our second study in philosophy. The study has two schools of thought: the first are the so-called encyclopedists, with skeptics like d'Alembert, others who believe in pantheism – like Diderot and Lamarck. The second group are outright atheists and materialists like d’Holbach, Lamettrie and Helvetius, followed by Concorcet, Lelande and Volney, all of whom are separate thinkers, but completely agree that tradition is the common enemy. As a result of prolonged argument and disagreement and their natural desire to be in control of everything and beat down opponents, all these parties soon become increasingly frustrated. They will not agree that Reason and tradition can be mutually supportive. They feel that when one enters, the other must leave. All this leads to the building of one prejudice against another. Voltaire, for example, has not desire to forget all about God, rather to keep Him around as a memory of past superstition and the good He did for mankind. But we should look closely at this superstition, which is so childlike. We accept it through faith, but faith should be regarded with suspicion. Faith comes through ignorance, fear, and imagination, all of which are powers in man that are deceptive.
