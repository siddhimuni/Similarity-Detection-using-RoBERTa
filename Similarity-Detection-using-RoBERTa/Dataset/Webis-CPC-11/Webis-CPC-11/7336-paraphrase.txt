Two of them were named, respectively, Charles P. Gillson and Graham Bartholomew, or, as it usually called, "Black Bart." Gillson had a room on the corner of Prickly Ash Street and Old Road Spring, Black Bart was in the use of Conrad & Co., guardians of the former Norfolk livery. Gillson was a son-in-law of former Gov.

But he could not generous or, rather, the romantic acts, because, during the firing of the Putnam House in this city last summer, two women rescued from the flames. Thus his left hand was burned so seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this scar can lead to their arrest.
