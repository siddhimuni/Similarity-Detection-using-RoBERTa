But the actual issue is rear these splendid voyagings, just as the  actual issue of Tasso is rear the battles of Christian and Saracen;
and within both poets the inmost theme is broadly the same. It is the consciousness of modern Europe. Jerusalem Delivered and the Lusiads are sprayed with the mettle of the Renaissance; and that is mainly responsible for their exquisite poetry. But they extend out towards the novel Europe that was otherwise just beginning. Europe making ordinary inflict against the peoples that are not Europe; Europe bringing her domination round the world--is that what Tasso and Camoens eventually mean? It would be too steely and too narrow a matter via itself towards earn these poems what they are. No; it is not the affair of Europe, but the mettle of European consciousness, that provided Tasso and Camoens their deepest inspiration. But what European consciousness genuinely is, these poets rather vaguely evoke than master into noticeable and irresistible equation, into the supreme symbolism of perfectly alright art. They still took European consciousness as an affair of geography and race rather than merely as a triumphant level within the general move of man's information of himself. Their moment imposed a obligation onto them; that they clearly understood. But they did not clearly appreciate what the obligation was; partly, none doubt, because they were both physically touched via mediaeval religion. And so it is atmosphere, within Tasso and Camoens, that scores much many than substance; both poets seem always thrilled via something they cannot express--the non so che of Tasso.
