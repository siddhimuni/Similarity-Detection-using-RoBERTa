Two winters were painful. The death of a very close companion added to the misery. He died in the spring of â€™42 under the adverse circumstances of war. Vauvenargues takes great pride in remembering the pathetic as well as the intrinsic worth of the destiny of his friend. This only reflects the approach of a young man too extravagant and theatrical to be accepted by a seasoned thought. He grumbled that it could not touch a single person who read it. But the matter of fact is that even a most gentle feeling fail to affect us if the expression is dull and unnatural. Vauvenargues fondness was distinctly very tender and sincere. If his life was smoother, this vulnerability would have been out of the world and morose. He was affectionate towards his friends with enduring lovability and composure. There was no concerns, whim, pride or any blemish  in his feelings which might let down the perception of his own individuality, and which is the root cause of any barrier to a smooth and humanitarian life.


He was a man of great depth and great values. No unpleasant everlasting situation in life could have affected him any way. Adversity of life did not bring any unpleasantness in him - he became more tolerant and sensible. There could not have been any better indication of dignified behavior.  


Apart from the pain and grief of the war, in his short life, Vauvenargues had to pass through unpleasant and embarrassing constricted ways of life.

The nature of route was not new and was followed by many young men in the world, in want of money. I am afraid,  he had undergone some adulteration while passing through such swampy roads of life. In an instance he thought of taking advantage of his wealthy neighbor with daughters.
