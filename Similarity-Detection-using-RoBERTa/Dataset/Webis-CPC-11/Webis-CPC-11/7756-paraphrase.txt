With that, he rushed on the Wanderer with a crying, swinging his great axe to fell him with a blow.

But while the giant was singing, the Wanderer shifted his place oh so slightly so the red blaze of the setting sun was shining on his face. As the giant came upon him, he reflected the bright shining sun off of his axe into the giantâ€™s eyes, blinding him. The Wanderer then smote at his bare right arm and struck the Giant's elbow joint. With all of his force, the Wanderer smote the giant with his sword, Euryalus, removing his arm with a firm grip on his axe. The stroke was so terrible that the bronze would not abide it and the blade was shattered from the ivory handle.

"Didst thou feel aught, thou Man-eater?" shouted Odysseus, jeering, for he know from the song of the giant that he was face to face with a wanderer from a horrible and evil race. A race of old called the Laestrygons from the land of the Midnight Sun had smitten his ships and devoured his men.

This did not stop the giant and he caught up his pine club in his left hand with his right arm still clinging tightly to it and he gnawed on the handle of the stone axe with his teeth and bit the very stone. Out of fury, his lips started to foam. He then suddenly smote at the Wanderer's head roaring loudly and crushed his golden helm so that he feel to his knee. Darkness was all around, but because they fought in the holy place of the ancient temple which was old and ruined before King Mena's day, his hands lit on a great stone. He took the stone with both hands and assaulted the head of a fallen statue of a God or man, a nameless king or of a forgotten God.
