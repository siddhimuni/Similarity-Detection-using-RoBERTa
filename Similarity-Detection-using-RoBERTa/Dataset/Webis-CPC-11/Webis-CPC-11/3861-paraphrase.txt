It must be remembered that in 1662 the Evening Prayer was said or sung in the afternoon only.

While the edifying effect of public Catechising is very great, it must be admitted that the introduction of Sunday-schools into the Church system, together with the change in the hours of Devine Service, have undoubtedly altered the conditions which rendered it necessary to provide so definite an order as this.

202. And all Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and Dames, shall cause their Children, Servants, and Apprentices, (which have not learned their Catechism,) to come to the Church at the time appointed, and obediently to and be ordered by the Curate, until such time as they have learned all that is here appointed for them to learn.

203. And every one shall have a Godfather, or a Godmother, as a Witness of their Confirmation.

The qualification for Confirmation, given in the rubric at the end of the Office for Public Baptism, seems to be here restricted by the addition of the words 'so soon as children are come to a competent age.' On the principle that the wider interpretation of the requisites for spiritual privileges should prevail ofer the narrower, this rubric should bso interpreted as not to conflict with the other.  In this view, the competency here intended does not consist in having arrived at a definite age, but in understanding what they are able to repeat with their lips. It should be observed that the word 'child' used in the rubric indicates, the language of the Canon Law, an age between seven and fourteen.

204. And whensoever the Bishop shall give knowledge for Children to be brought unto him for their Confirmation, the Curate of every Parish shall either bring, or send in writing, with his hand subscribed thereunto, the names of all such persons within his Parish, as he shall think fit to be presented to the Bishop to be confirmed.
