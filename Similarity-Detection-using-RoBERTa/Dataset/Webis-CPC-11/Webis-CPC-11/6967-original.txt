He was the last man discharged previous to the general mustering out. On the 13th the men whose terms of service did not expire before the 1st of October were transferred to and ordered to join the Fifth Regiment; those from Company E being as follows: Bryan, Foglesang, Frank, Hildebrandt, Holtzmer, Iwan, Knopf, Lieber, and Troska. 

 While at Montgomery, by change of captains in Company D, Company E became the first in rank, its appropriate position in regimental line being the first on the right flank, with Company I on the left. 

 After much weary waiting the regiment at last received orders to proceed to Vicksburg, to be mustered out, and, joyfully striking tents for the last time, on the 16th embarked on the steamer Coquette for Selma, which place was reached next morning. Here, instead of proceeding at once, the regiment remained three days by reason of change of opinions in regard to the recruits just transferred. The order transferring them was revoked, and they were returned to their companies to be mustered out with the main body. 

 The strength of Company E was now as follows: Present, 60; absent, 6,--aggregate, 62. 

 On the 20th, left Selma by railroad. 

 Reached Demopolis in the afternoon, and descended the river there, on a steamboat, four miles to the continuation of the railroad on the west bank, which place was known as McDowell's Landing. Here camped for the night. The next day arrived at Meridian, Mississippi, and lay there over night, and on the day after, the 22nd, arrived at Pearl River opposite Jackson. Owing to the destruction of the bridge over this stream, and that of the Big Black, there was a gap of over thirty miles in the railroad communication, which had to be traversed the best way possible.
