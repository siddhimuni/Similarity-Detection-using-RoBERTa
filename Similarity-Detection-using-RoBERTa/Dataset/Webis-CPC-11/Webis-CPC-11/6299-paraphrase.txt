I won't tell you exactly what became of Jane.  Let's just say my interest in this book evaporated when she found a "way out" of this life.  Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY is a descriptive writer with notable gifts and talents, and I can only complain that the book would be better if Jane had been kept alive--Army or no, she was worth a whole legion of John-Andrews.  The Vagueners were crazy, but they were from Cornwall, which explains everything, apparently.  Novelists always write Cornish people as nutters.

Mr. HUGH ELLIOT's volume (CONSTABLE) is hardly light reading.  However, certain vulgar-minded people may wax merry over the first swear-word of the philosopher (age 36), as laid forth in the matter of a tangled fishing line.  They may also enjoy the latter picture of a middle-aged man chasing down a Neopolitan who had taken his opera-glasses.  Such wonderful human traits.  They will strike the normal man as bewilderingly un-normal.  The serious-flippant reader, tackling Elliot's acute, elaborate analyses, may get an impression of an old apriorist, a stubborn White Knight/philosopher, with all manner of inventions at his saddle-bow, including such labels as "Homogeneity-Heterogeneity,""Ghost Theory,""Unknowable," and "Presentative-Representative."  These don't seem quite as helpful as their inventor seems to have thought them to be.  Certainly, he took tosses into many of the holes and traps of this dangerous deduction-method he chose.  I don't pretend this is Mr. Elliot's view.  He is critical-respectful, and makes maybe the best case possible for his old master's claim to greatness on the assumption that Spencer himself, being the stark enemy to dogmatism and authority, would have preferred the critical examination of a biographer to any mere "master's-voice" reproduction of Spencerian doctrine.  I wonder if that's true or not!

The latest story by Miss F.E. Mills Young has at least one merit to its credit--no one who has seen the title can thereafter complain of having been taken by surprise by the course of the narrative.  I suppose it's just as well, because having discovered at the beginning the sufficiently charming Pam living in an ongoing honeymoon with a man so well-off, handsome, and singularly unoccipied as to be able to take unlimited car trips and go to unending dinner parties, we might have imagined the jolly meaningless thing to continue as it started and so been truly shocked like dear Pam upon reading that fatal letter.  But, knowing the book to be called straight out The Bigamist, we could have no possible trouble discerning the emergence of that other wife, buried in the past, waiting to pounce down on Pam's happiest moment (poor Pam!).  Of course she appeared, in due time.  Not that such glee could have lasted long in any case, for the man was a flat-out cad, undeserving of the notice of the foolish women he managed to attract, all three of them.  Nor worth your attention, for that matter.  I will leave the rest to your perusal, or better still, imagination.  The only hint I give is that the end has some tiny bit of dignity that redeems the volume, a little.
