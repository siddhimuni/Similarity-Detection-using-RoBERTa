RITUAL DANCING

It is unnecessary to labor the conclusion of the last two or three chapters, namely that Christianity
grew out of the former Pagan Creeds and is in its general outlook and origins continuous and
of one piece with them. I have not attempted to bring together ALL the evidence in favor of
this contention, as such work would be too vast, but more illustrations of its truth will doubtless
occur to readers, or will emerge as we proceed.

I think we may take it as proved (1) that from the earliest ages, and before History, a great
body of religious belief and ritual--first appearing among very primitive and unformed folk,
whom we should call 'savages'--has come slowly down, broadening and differentiating itself
on the way into a great variety of forms, but embodying always certain main ideas which became
in time the accepted doctrines of the later Churches--the Indian, the Egyptian, the Mithraic,
the Christian, and so forth. What these ideas in their general outline have been we can perhaps
best judge from our "Apostles' Creed," as it is recited every Sunday in our churches.

Here we have the All-Father and Creator, descending from the Sky in the form of a spirit to
impregnate the earthly Virgin-mother, who thus gives birth to a Saviour-hero. The latter is
slain by the powers of Evil, is buried and descends into the lower world, but arises again
as God into heaven and becomes the leader and judge of mankind. We have the confirmation of
the Church (or, in earlier times, of the Tribe) by means of a Eucharist or Communion which
binds together all the members, living or dead, and restores errant individuals through the
Sacrifice of the hero and the Forgiveness of their sins; and we have the belief in a bodily
Resurrection and continued life of the members within the fold of the Church (or Tribe), itself
regarded as eternal. I need not enlarge upon a thesis which is self-evident from all that has
gone before. I do not say, of course, that ALL the religious beliefs of Paganism are included
and summarized in our Apostles' Creed, for--as I shall have occasion to note in the next chapter--I
think some very important religious elements are there OMITTED; but I do think that all the
beliefs which ARE summarized in the said creed had already been fully represented and elaborately
expressed in the non-Christian religions and rituals of Paganism.

Further (2) I think we may safely say that there is no certain proof that the body of beliefs
just mentioned sprang from any one particular centre far back and radiated thence by dissemination
and mental contagion over the rest of the world; but the evidence rather shows that these beliefs
were, for the most part, the SPONTANEOUS outgrowths (in various localities) of the human mind
at certain stages of its evolution; that they appeared, in the different races and peoples,
at different periods according to the degree of evolution, and were largely independent of
intercourse and contagion, though of course, in cases, considerably influenced by it; and that
one great and all-important occasion and provocative of these beliefs was actually the RISE
OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS--that is, the coming of the mind to a more or less distinct awareness
of itself and of its own operation, and the consequent development and growth of Individualism,
and of the Self-centred attitude in human thought and action.
