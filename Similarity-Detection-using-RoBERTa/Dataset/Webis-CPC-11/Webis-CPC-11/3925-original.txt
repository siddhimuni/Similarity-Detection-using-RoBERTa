On our return we found ten men, besides the two we had killed before
we joined our friends. Seeing that they did not yet recognize us, it being dark, we again asked,
how many of our braves had been killed? They said five. We asked who they were. They replied
that the first party of three, who went out to meet the American war chief, had all been taken
prisoners, and killed in the encampment; and that out of a party of five who followed to see
the meeting of the first party and the whites, two had been killed. We were now certain that
they did not recognize us, nor did we tell them who we were, until we arrived at our camp.
The news of our death had reached it some time before, and all were surprised to see us again."[8]

Such is the narrative of this defeat, as given by Black Hawk, and two of his men who were the
bearers of his white flag and a proposition to surrender. The accounts given by Major Stillman's
troops--for it is not ascertained that the commander published any official statement of the
battle--is in substance about the following. The force under Major Stillman, two hundred and
seventy-five in number, on the afternoon of the fourteenth of May, met three Indians bearing
a white flag, one of whom, after having been taken prisoner, was shot down. The army encamped
just before sunset, in a piece of woods, surrounded by an open prairie, about three miles from
Sycamore creek. Soon after they had halted, five more Indians, with apparent pacific intentions,
were seen approaching the camp. Captain Eades, with a party of armed troops, dashed at full
speed towards them, when they became alarmed and commenced a retreat. The Captain, after following
them for some distance, and killing two of the party, gave up the pursuit, and was on his return
to the camp, when he was met by the whole detachment. The pursuit of the retreating Indians
was immediately renewed, and continued until both parties had crossed Sycamore creek.
