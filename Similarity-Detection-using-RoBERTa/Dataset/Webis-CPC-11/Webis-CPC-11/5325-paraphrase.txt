It was unique in the kissing excercises that he found Tishy Morgan, an angry red-head. She was a med student who wasn't invited. Dr. Mangan  took his name off the list saying there were already enough people, and Tishy didn't argue. Dr. Mangan always said he left his household affairs to the ladies. He didn't say that he held hands with the ladies.  His daughter felt like she should sulk and get revenge on "his fine pet,". Who cares if Master Coppinger owns the Louvre, for all she cared. Pappy couldn't tell her what to do. THen she thought of Ned. 

As the evning went on the cuckoo clock rang at midnight. THe normal dresses were there. Larry was trying ot hook up with a young lady to get her to the top of the stairs and kiss her - either her shoes or her lips, as he said, it was her choice. 

The evening continued with lots of commotion, eating, and a very hot room that the old people expecially noticed. 

It is funny how the offenses of childhood are forgotten by adults. Mrs. Whelpley said that LArry should stop pouting, that he was very naughty and she would punish him. The doctor laughedheartily.  Tishy was cornered and accepted it all. 

Tishy and larry were furious with eachother as they climbed the stairs. He demanded that she kiss him. She was taller than him. But she kissed him on the lips. 

Finally when they kissed it was better than they expected. She returned his spark. This suprised Larry.
