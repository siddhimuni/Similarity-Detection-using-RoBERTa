The researcher has applied pressure of upwards of 20,000 atmospheres to metals that possess the property in question, and found that even these enormous pressures produce very little change in density.  Solids read a maximum density, which cannot be modified by pressure.  The only way to change the density of a solid is to change the temperature.  However, some solids can take an allotropic condition of greater density.  The researcher had previously showed that solids in allotropic state could assume the volume of their container, which is analogous to the aggregation of matter.  This raises the possibility that both phenomena are the result of the same cause-- polymerization.  The elasticity of a body can be thought of as its response to pressure, when it reaches the critical pressure where it begins to flow.  For example, ice can be forced to flow at 0c. by applying enough pressure.  In this sense, brittle objects are ones which do not flow under pressure.  

Hydrogen Amalgam

Hydrogen is a gas but it is a chemically a metal, and it can form alloys with solid metals.  Hydrogen can also form a compound with liquid mercury, and the resulting fluid can be thought of not as an alloy but as an amalgam of hydrogen and mercury, or the "hydrogen amalgam."  One of the problems with mercury is its "sickening" and its "flouring" and loss.  Engineers and scientists have been searching for a solution to a problem for a long time now.
