Zhing, which is converted rightly sufficient "essence," is the more subtle and untainted part of matter-- the grosser pattern of the elementary ether; Khi, or "spirit," is the wind, still material but purer than the zhing, and is made of the finer and more hardworking pattern of ether. In the hwun, or soul (animus) the Khi predominates and the zhing (or zing) in the pho or animal soul. At death the hwun (Or religious soul) rambles away, ascending, and the pho (the origin of the Tibetan phrase Pho-hat) descends and is altered into a ghostly shadow (the shell). Dr. Medhurst conceives that "the Kwei Shans" (see "Theology of the Chinese," pp. 10-12) are "the increasing and contracting values of human life!" "The Kwei Shans" are conveyed about by the dissolution of the human frame--and comprise of the increasing and ascending Shan which rambles about in space, and of the bound and shrivelled Kwei, which reverts to soil and nonentity. Therefore, the Kwei is the personal body; the Shan is the crucial standard the Kwei Shan the linga-sariram, or the crucial soul; Zhing the fourth standard or Kama Rupa, the essence of will; pho, the animal soul; Khi, the religious soul; and Hwun the untainted spirit--the seven values of our occult doctrine!--Ed.

Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man

It is now very tough to state what was the genuine very vintage Aryan doctrine. If an inquirer were to try to response it by an investigation and evaluation of all the diverse schemes of esotericism current in India, he will shortly be lost in a maze of obscurity and uncertainty. No evaluation between our genuine Brahmanical and the Tibetan esoteric doctrines will be likely except one ascertains the teachings of that so-called "Aryan doctrine," and completely comprehends the entire variety of the very vintage Aryan philosophy. Kapila's "Sankhya," Patanjali's "Yog philosophy," the distinct schemes of "Saktaya" beliefs, the diverse Agamas and Tantras are but parts of it. There is a doctrine, though, which is their genuine base, and which is adequate to interpret the mysteries of these diverse schemes of beliefs and harmonize their teachings. It likely lived long before the Vedas were amassed, and it was revised by our very vintage Rishis in attachment with the Hindu scriptures. It is attributed to one secret personage called Maha.*.....

The Upanishads and such portions of the Vedas as are not chiefly dedicated to the public ceremonials of the very vintage Aryans are barely intelligible without some information of that doctrine. Even the genuine implication of the impressive ceremonials mentioned to in the Vedas will not be flawlessly apprehended without its lightweight being hurl upon them. The Vedas were possibly amassed mostly for the use of the clerics aiding at public observance, but the grandest deductions of our genuine mystery doctrine are therein mentioned. I am acquainted by individuals competent to referee of the issue, that the Vedas have a distinct dual meaning--one conveyed by the literal sense of the phrases, the other demonstrated by the metre and the swara (intonation), which are, as it were the life of the Vedas. Learned Pundits and philologists of course refute that swara has any thing to manage with beliefs or very vintage esoteric doctrines; but the secret attachment between swara and lightweight is one of its most deep secrets.

Now, it is exceedingly tough to display if the Tibetans drawn from their doctrine from the very vintage Rishis of India, or the very vintage Brahrnans wise their occult research from the adepts of Tibet; or, afresh, if the adepts of both nations professed initially the identical doctrine and drawn from it from a widespread source.* If you were to proceed to the Sramana Balagula, and inquiry some of the Jain Pundits there about the authorship of the Vedas and the source of the Brahmanical esoteric doctrine, they would likely notify you that the Vedas were created by Rakshasas** or Daityas, and that the Brahmans had drawn from their mystery information from them.***

** A kind of demons-devil.

*** And so would the Christian padris. But they would not ever accept that their "fallen angels" were scrounged from the Rakshasas; that their "devil" is the illegitimate child of Dewel, the Sinhalese feminine demon; or that the "war in heaven" of the Apocalypse--the base of the Christian dogma of the "Fallen Angels" was made a replicate from the Hindu article about Siva hurling the Tarakasura who rebelled contrary to the gods into Andhahkara, the abode of Darkness, as asserted by Brahmanical Shastras. ---------

Do these claims signify that the Vedas and the Brahmanical esoteric teachings had their source in the lost Atlantis--the countries that one time used by a substantial piece of the expanse of the Southern and the Pacific oceans?
