PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

CHARIVARIA.

"Where Stands Germany To-day?" asks a headline. She doesn't. At least Count BROCKDORFF-RANTZAU
kept his seat while addressing the Peace Conference. This discourtesy however need not be taken
too seriously. It is pointed out that by the time Germany has complied with the Peace terms
she may not be able to sit down.

       ***

The Soviet Government has adopted a new calendar, in which the year will commence on October
25th. We ourselves have always, associated the first day of January with some of the most repugnant
features of capitalism.

       ***

A resident of Balham who was last week bitten by a member of a Jazz band is now wondering whether
he ought to submit to the PASTEUR treatment or just allow the thing to run its own course.

       ***

Several of our migratory birds have not yet returned to these shores. It is supposed that the
spirit of competition has been aroused in them by the repeated rumours of a Trans-Atlantic
flight and that they have started to race on foot across Europe.

       ***

"Where is all the Cheese?" asks an Evening News' headline. A correspondent has suggested that
it might be nesting-time.

       ***

Wallasey's Corporation has decided to exclude boys under sixteen from the municipal golf course.
No child, the Mayor explains, should be allowed to witness its father's shame.

       ***

"Steps should be taken to make the clergy presentable and attractive," says the Vicar of St.
Jude's, Hampstead. A little baby ribbon insertion, it is suggested, would give a certain dash
to the carpet slippers without impairing their essential dignity.

       ***

The Ebbw Vale cat that is suspected of having rabies is still under observation. The belief
is gaining ground, however, that she was merely trying to purr in Welsh.

       ***

North of England gas managers have passed a resolution urging the appointment of a Director-General
of Light, Heat and Power. But surely the functions of such an office are already performed
by Mr. SPEAKER.

       ***

Swallows, says a contemporary, have been seen flying over the Serpentine. Most of the snap
was taken out of the performance by the fact that none of them delivered The Daily Mail.

       ***

A fine specimen of the rare white female dolphin, a very infrequent visitor to our shores,
has been killed off Yarmouth. We'll learn white female dolphins to visit us!

       ***

The National Historical Society have cabled to Mr. WILSON that they are supporting Italy's
claim to Fiume. It is only fair to point out that Mr. Smith of Norwood has not yet reached
a decision on the point.

       ***

A Sinn Fein M.P. has been recaptured at Finglas, co. Dublin. It would be interesting to know why.

       ***

The Board of Agriculture are of the opinion that rabies might be spread by rats. In view of
this there is some talk of calling upon householders to muzzle their rats.

       ***

According to a Sunday paper a husband recently stated that a former lodger ran away with his
wife. She was a German, and nobody can understand why they ran.

       ***

An anarchist arrested in Holland with a bomb in his possession explained that it was for the
ex-Kaiser. We have since been informed that the retired monarch denies that he ever placed
such an order with the gentleman.

       ***

A well-known golf club has recently engaged a totally deaf caddy. The idea is to induce more
clergymen to join the club.

       ***

As no joke about the Isle of Wight Railway has appeared in any comic paper for at least a month,
it is supposed that either a new engine has been bought or that the old one has been thoroughly
overhauled.

       ***

A picture post-card sent off in 1910 has just arrived at its destination. It is presumed that
one of the sorters who originally handled it is breaking up his collection.

       ***

It will take ten years, says a Post Office official, to replace the present telephone system
with automatic exchanges. Persons who have already registered calls are urged not to make too
much of this slight additional delay.

       ***

Every one, says the Secretary of the National Federation of Fish Friers, wants the trade to
be a respectable one.
