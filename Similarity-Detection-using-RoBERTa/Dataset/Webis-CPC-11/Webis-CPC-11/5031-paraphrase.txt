After the wound has been inflicted, it may be that infectious material was introduced, but one one may also have no proof that this shall have any consequence.  Whenever one has these doubts, one hesitates to cut the capsule of the joint (to drain fluid, or to wash the capsule) unless it is clear that one must move hastily to do so.

Luckily, Frost[19] can come to our aid with advice.  Before getting to any business of cutting and invading the joint, simple cleansing of the outside of the joint, by shaving hair from around the wound, washing the skin, and disinfecting the wound should be done.  Remember that this isn't a procedure to perform once, but to repeat it 2 to 3 times a day.  The strong antiseptic, 20% Lugol's solution in glycerin can be injected into the wound as it doesn't irritate the tissue but instead helps to reduce inflammation.

Now that we have handled the initial treatment, consider the ongoing care of the wound.  The frequency of redressing the wound should be varied as necessary: the there is a lot of pus discharged, change dressings daily.  But on the whole, semi-weekly changes of dressings are all that are necessary.  Moreover don't worry if access to the patient is restricted, as only changing the dressing weekly will suffice after the initial couple of treatments.

One final matter is to distinguish between two classes of wounds: where the interior of the join is open to view; and where an openings are just small punctures.  In the first case, free drainage is obviously already provided for, but in the second, drainage is not free.  Remember that free drainage is necessary to help prevent the infection spread through nearby tissues.
