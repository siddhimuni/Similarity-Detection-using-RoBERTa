But if the accent be on the last syllable, though it is strictly right to place it there also in English, it is not worth while to do so, for fear of making hearers talk about a strange sound, instead of attending to the service. It will be safer to accent the penultimate in dissyllables, and the antepenultimate in trisyllables, which in the Greek are acutitones; in fact, to pronounce, as all clergymen used to pronounce, until a pedantic and ignorant practice arose of lengthening, or rather accenting, every syllable in the penultimate, which had or was supposed to have a long quantity in Greek. Hence the comparatively new habit of pronouncing [Greek: Sabaôth], [Greek: Zaboulôn], [Greek: sabachthani], [Greek: Akeldama], with a strong accent on the penultima; whereas the old-fashioned way of accenting the antepenultima makes no one stare, and is a much nearer approach to the true pronunciation. There is a curious inconsistency in the common way of reading, in English, [Greek: Samareia] and [Greek: Kaisareia]. Samar[=i]a is decidedly a Greek word; but yet, in this word, it is usual to accent the antepenultima. Cesar[)e]a is decidedly a Latin word Græcised, and yet it is usual to read this with an accent on the penultima. I never observed any of those who read Sabáoth, Zabúlon, and sabachtháni, read either Samaría or Cesárea. The Greek accents on Hebrew words always accord, as Hebraists know, with the tonic accent in that language.

As a contribution to the desirable object of settling the pronunciation of the words mentioned, the following representation of their pronunciation in the originals is offered. The vowels are to be read as in Italian, the th as in English, and the hh as ch in German: 

Hebrew. Sabaoth = ts[)i]-v[=a]-['=o]th. 

Hebrew. [The] Moriah = [h[)a]m-]m['=o]-r[=i]-y['=a]h. 

Syriac. Aceldama = hh[)i]-k[')a]l-d[)i]-m['=a]. 

Syro-Chaldee. Eli Eli lamma sabachthani = [=e]-l['=i] [=e]l['=i] l[)a]m-m['=a] s[)a]-b[')a]hh-t[)a]-n['=i], as in Matthew; or [)e]-l['=o]-h[=i], as in Mark.
