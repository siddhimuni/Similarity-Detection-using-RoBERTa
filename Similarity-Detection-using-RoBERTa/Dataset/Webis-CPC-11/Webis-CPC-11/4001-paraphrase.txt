Trying to be creative listeners and asked questions to the group that would make them want to share their personal experiences because we felt it to be necessary.

"We felt pretty relaxed. We tried to tune into the needs of each couple.We were hoping we didn't say too much."

"We felt we were equal participants with the other people and pushers of a process that was well started with honest conversation.Agenda-building was done several times.We were trying to make a feeling where defensiveness would be replaces with a tolerable acceptance.We wanted trust to grow so we could hear each other and learn."

             UNFELT NEED WAS A PROBLEM

"Marriage enrichment retreats meet an unfilled need.People don't feel too sure they need it.If you think your marriage is good you don't feel the need to spend a weekend to make it even better.To get the best from this retreat you need a person to talk who is sensible and knows what's going on."

Some thoughts were considered as to why our program would be met with some resistance.It takes problems to make married people seek help.Sometimes that help may come to late.Or sometimes married couples are aware that the relationship falls short in some areas.It can take a strong push to get these couples to enroll in a retreat.

Why the resistance in this day and age is commonly known as the "generation gap."
