Only the eyes of a spectator have the capability to refine into beauty a landscape, because in itself, a landscape is not beauty. It is considered a work of art, as nature has furnished the raw material that it needed, so the eyes of the beholder can look at it by endowing it, and fashion it artistiscally. Threfore only the spectator is empowered with the ability to see the beauty in nature.

Is it possible for the peasant to ridicule the city where man has deceived himself to the extent that he had became enthusiastic over the beauties of a landscape which leaves the other quite cool.In order for a person to paint a beautiful landscape in his head, he must first know something about the artist. Nature is beautiful, but its beauty resides in the eyes of the beholder. The comprehension of artistic beauty does not depend only on great cultural presuppositons, but also on the comprehension of the naturally beautiful. We have a new "vision" for a different kind of natural beauty with every great evolution of civilization.

This has gone so far to a point that one might even be deceived into thinking that different period in time had looked upon the beauty of nature not only with different mental pictures, but also with different way of looking at things. Most of our old artists have painted nature from a view point of a farsighted person, but our generation thinks that they can get closer to the truth if they can paint from the angle of vision of a nearsighted person.A farsighted painter will tend to paint a synthetic nature, but a nearsighted one will paint closer to the reality of life.This illustration can be compared to the old Italian tree which leaves are numbered.
