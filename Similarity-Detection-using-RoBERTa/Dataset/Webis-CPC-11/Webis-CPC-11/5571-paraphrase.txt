The easy side of Stephen's personality was oddly charismatic; this secret, dullness and immaturity, counted more for his popularity than his more obvious qualities. To the local ladies in Harmouth, he was gorgeous, but he wasn't really. Nicely kept man, tall, dark and messy hair,smiling eyes (due to a crease at the corners), and a high, bony nose. His mouth was unpleasant and ironic, saved only by his smile. His smazzy dress and out-of-town talk impressed the women of harmouth. They longed for something new.

The conclusion of French's true self was not Deena's guess,she saw him coming--his visage was nothing to be impressed by. He gave her his regrets of his tardiness and his cigar, she recieved them then left toward the water.

The shore at wolfshead was rocky, pebbles and seaweed (blackened) tossed around, indicating the reach of the tide. Stephen beckoned Deena, wiped her seat, and she sat down."You would be more comfortable," he said "if Ben would come with the cushions."

I do fine without she replied. I can only abhor the paul and virginia attitude. I think a year would be enough for their greed. I ask myself if they'd continue stranded with no place to go. Stephen asked if she could be happy stranded with her love. And Deena and that she wouldn't unless there was something to keep him happy. Stephen quickly said I suspect you've done some reading and it's all well and good but he ought corroborate his findings. I appreciate him though. 
Deena seemed happy by this. She says he should give him some slack he's not rich and he doesn't have a lot of time.

Stephen suggests that he  must get rid of all his destractions to dedicate himself to science. That's what will make him the best. Deena wihed they had more money. Stephen hesitates on his decision to pull out a letter. He examines his thoughts.
