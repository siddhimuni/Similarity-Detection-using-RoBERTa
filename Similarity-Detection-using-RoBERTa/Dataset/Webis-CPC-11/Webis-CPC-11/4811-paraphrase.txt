Some people dream their died relatives or friends. They have to seek what appeared in the dream. Of course they cannot see the body as it was buried or swallowed up in the sea . However they had pictured something thatwas in their mind. It may be little soul of air and fire which wandered some where. 
      When we try to separate the matter it is sure that the soul is tangible and in the ancient times there was no idea about Soul. At last  Plato tried to tried to explain it but somehow he also cannot sift soul from the matter. This problem was unsolved until faith came to enlighten us.
    Some materialists tried to make believe us that the Priests of Church are not able to convey precisely  the facts about soul.St.Irenaeus says Soul is incorporeal only compared to mortal body and it own a form of man that we can recognize.
   Tertullian express that the image of the soul do not have the image of the body.He also recorded the vision of a holy woman who had a shining soul of the colour of the air.
        St. Hilarius says that everything is formed by elements and they are visible to everybody.If there is a soul it will be tangible.
             St.Ambrose says we can only recognize materialistic things except Trinity.
  But all these arguements are vain arguments.All these saints had a mistake in their understanding.But the entire church believed that soul is immaterial. The immortality of the soul is accepted by everyone that it is clearly announced in the Gospel.
            But on the whole the church have to decide on points of philosphy so as to provide us with enough information of what is "pure spiri" and what is "matter"
