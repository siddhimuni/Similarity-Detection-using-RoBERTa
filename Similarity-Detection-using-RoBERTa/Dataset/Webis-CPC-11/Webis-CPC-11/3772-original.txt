Our thoughtful friend, Grandpapa, whom we had left a fortnight before at Rättijärvi, was waiting
for us at Nyslott, or rather, a moment after the ship stopped at the quayside in the early
dawn of morning, he arrived, accompanied by a man in a boat, one of those regular Finnish boats
pointed at each end known as a kuiru.

"Where are we to live?" we called, over the side.

"In the Castle, as you wished," was the reply; and overjoyed at the prospect of anything so
romantic, we quickly transferred ourselves and our baggage into the boat below.

"I'm very anxious about this arrangement," said our youthful old friend. "When I arrived a
fortnight ago, and found there was not a room to be had in the town, I was in despair; after
wandering from house to house, again I beseeched the little hotel to take me in; but even their
sofas were occupied. However, determining not to leave Nyslott till I had seen the famous castle,
I got a boat and rowed across. Veni, vidi, vici--for I persuaded the watchman to put me up
for the night, and there I am still. When, yesterday, I could find no habitation for you, I
reluctantly telegraphed that the town was full and I was only put up by the Vahtimestari of
the Castle. Imagine my horror when I got your reply--'Arrive 4 A.M., arrange stay Castle.'"

"Were you so very much horrified?" we laughed. "We thought it would be such fun, and so delightfully
romantic."

"It was no fun to me. I felt utterly taken aback, and went off to consult an artist friend,
who was painting the queer old place.
