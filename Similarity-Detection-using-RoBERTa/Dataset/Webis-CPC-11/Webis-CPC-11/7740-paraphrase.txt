The production of gangrenous sloughs generally resembles the description of sloughing ulcers. When someone has a gangrenous slough, a portion of the parts immediatel adjacent to the ulcer loose its life and a fresh slough form in the same manner. Sloughs are generally black with ashy edges. I have not been able to verify any change of color, the production of vesciles or any material tumefaction. By the time it is removed, there is an increase in heat in the parts called "calor mordens". 

The first process is to extend the edges of the gums. When it reaches the edges of the bony socket, the tooth begins to be loose and almost looks like fangs. From this you can see that the latter membrane is the part most apt to be the cause off injury or death from disease in the mouth. An injury like this usually proceeds with augmenting rapidly especially when it has gotten to the deeper parts of the gums. While it is spreading is when it will cause a gangrene.
