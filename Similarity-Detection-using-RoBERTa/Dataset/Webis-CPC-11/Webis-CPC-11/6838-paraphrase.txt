"That," said BaLFOU,Q.C.,who chanced to be on the
Front Opposition Bench."is a striking example of the
misapprehension under which acte minds occasionally
labour.l have known mu Right Hon.friend for many years:we have sat on this Bench together in Oppositon,and have worked in the same Ministry,and l
confess it is a little shocking to me to hear him accused of tendency to enter upon controversial topics. I am myself a man of peace. and do not readily assume an attitude of reproof: but,as MR.HENRY ARTHUR WILSON said when he stood ov r the improvised Baccarat-table with a piece of chalk in his hand,the line must be drawn somewhere, and I am inclined to rule it at the place where my friend HARCOURT is accused of wilfully and designedly dissturbing the Parliamentary peace."Business done.--Still on the Land Bill.

Friday Night.--Still grinding away at the report stage of Land Bill:don't gat any forrader,been at it a week, and to-night just as many Amendments on the paper as there were on Monday. All night upon a single new Clause. Everybody wearied to death. Even WINDBAG SEXTON a little moody: not had such a good night as usual:the debate lasting throughout sitting. and. there being only one Motion before the House. SEXTON (with the SPEAKER in the Chair) could spoeak only once: that he did. at considerable length.

But a poor consolation for lost opportunity.

Congratulated the suffering SPEAKER on this accident:pointed out to him thing were bad enough: but might be worse.

"I suppose.TOBY."you never read PROIR?

Haven't looked him up for many years:but, sitting here through this week.there is one couplet--from his Solomon.I think--ever running through my mind:--
 
'ABRA was ready ere I called her name: And. though I call'd another. ABRA came.'

Just like SEXTON."

"GREY APES OF AGE."

"Grey hair is fashionable for the youthful."Says a Mode oracle acknowledged truthful. Strange that Society should have a rage For that anomaly--artificial Agel

Dust on their heads our pretty women toss. Just to deprive it of its prstine gloss.

Make ashen-white your eyebrows.there. and lashes. Precoius hags! The world's but dust and ashes. Wrinkles and crowsfeet next must have their turn(To limn them in let toilette artists learn).Then make each belle bald.scraggy-necked and toothless. Grey haer alone won't make Society youthless. Let belles if they find it jolly.But they might be consistent in their folly!
