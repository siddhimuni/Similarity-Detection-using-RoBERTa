Spekulerer er, at med en dødelige interne sygdom til at kæmpe med, han bør har stået over for sine fjender så lang tid. Han gik faktisk til retten, på trods af et koldt, tages i en unaired hus; for statsministeren nu forlod Downing Street for Arlington Street. Domstolen blev overfyldt, han fundet med gamle damer, hustruer af patrioter der ikke havde været der for disse 20 år, og som optrådte i de accoutrements, der var modefarve i dronning Anne tid. "Så", skriver han, "den glæde og akavede jollity af dem er inexpressible! Ministeren havde besat sine senere år i trækker ned hans gamle forfædres hus på Houghton, og i opbygningen af en enorm Herregård, som har siden sin tid været, til gengæld delvist ødelagt. Når Harley, Earl af Orford, var kendt for at skabe et stort hus for sig selv, havde Sir Robert bemærkede, at en minister, som gjorde det har begået en stor imprudence. Når Houghton blev påbegyndt, mindet Sir Hynde Aston Sir Robert af dette indlæg. «Du burde har mindede om det mig før, 'var svaret;' for før jeg begyndte bygning, det kunne have været til nytte for mig.» Denne berømte mindesmærke af Walpolean storhed, denne pragtfulde galskab, konstrueret, det er generelt meningen, på offentlige penge, blev beboet af Sir Robert kun ti dage i sommer, og tyve dage i vinter; til efteråret, skyde sæson, to måneder. Det blev næsten en eyesore til de rolige landadel, der viste slottet med en følelse af deres egne mindreværdsfølelse. Folk så godt som Walpoles bøde i deres gable-afsluttet, moderat mellemstore boliger; og der var Sir Robert, at indstille dem på så enorme afstand? Houghton, gigantiske i proportionerne, havde den vulgære forståelsen af Premier, dens formål. Han samlet der sine tilhængere; der, underholdt han for en kort tid, sine vælgere og coadjutors med en storslået, jovial gæstfrihed, som han, med sin homoseksuelle spiritus, sin humourous, taktløst vittigheder og sin uafhængige god-karakter, var meget sjæl. Fri samtale, hårdt-drikke, blev funktionerne i hver dag fest. «Dette sted,» Sir Robert, i 1743, skrev til general Churchill, fra Houghton,' frembyder ingen nyheder, intet emne af underholdning eller morskab; for fine mænd vid og fornøjelse om byen forstår sproget og smag, hverken fornøjelsen af livløs verden. Min flatterers her er alle mutes: oaks, beeches, kastanjer, synes at strides som bedst skal venligst Herre for Herregård. De kan ikke vildlede; de vil ikke lyve. Jeg ærligt beundrer dem og har så mange smukke oplevelser om mig som fylder alle mine timer dangling, og ingen skændsel deltage mig, fra 60-syv år. Inden døre vi komme lidt nærmere til det virkelige liv, og beundrer, efter den næsten taler lærred, alle airs og graces proudest mine damer kan prale.» I disse sider af samme sag Horace indtrængende delt. Gennem sin agentur, Horace Mann, stadig i den diplomatiske tjeneste, i Firenze, valgt og købt af kunstværker, som blev sendt til Arlington Street, eller til form den berømte Houghton Collection, som Horace så ofte henviser i dette dejlige arbejde, sin 'anekdoter af maleobjekt.» Blandt de diakritiske tegn af Houghton blev haver de dyreste. » Sir Robert har glæder sig, «skrev Pulteney, Earl af bad, «med skabe paladser og udvide parker, udplantning haver i steder som selve jorden var skal transporteres i vogne, og embracing kaskader og springvand hvis vand var kun at være opnået ved aqueducts og maskiner og efterligne luksus Orientalsk konger, på bekostning af en frie mennesker, som han har på én gang forarmede og forrådt.» Ex-ministeren gik til en stor regning af dyrkningen af planter, købte Uvedales "Hortus Siccus;' og modtaget fra Bradley, professor of Botany på Cambridge, hyldest af et engagement, som blev det sagt, at"Sir Robert havde købt en af de fineste samlinger af planter i rige.» Mere til hans ære stadig var Sir Robert bevarelse af St. James's Park for befolkningen. Begejstret for udendørs underholdning selv, Premier hørt, med forfærdelse, et forslag fra de dronning Caroline til at konvertere den antikke park til et palads haven. «Hun spurgte min far, 'Horace Walpole vedrører,' hvad ændringen muligvis kunne koste?»--Kun tre kroner var det civile, vittig, åbent svar. Dronningen var klog nok til at tage tippet. Det er muligt hun betød at konvertere parken til haver, der bør være åbne for offentligheden som i Berlin, Mannheim og endda Tuileries.
