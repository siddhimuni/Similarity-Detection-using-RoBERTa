A copy sold at a Belfast auction(recorded by Willems)proves that copies could very possible still exist in this country. Every now and then a copy appears in the salesrooms of London, and at Brighton another copy was found. Little imaginative effort is required to see merchants and those who travel, who happened to make their way through the Low Countries during that time, putting copies into their pockets to use in household across the waters. Many of those who were exiled during the Protectorate , looking throughout the bookstores in Amsteredam, must have happened upon a copy as a present to a daughter or wife.

Numbers as well,must have made their way to France. Some time back our book-hunter stayed at an old hostel in Rouen. The outside appearance of the building was completely antique. It was located one of the back narrow allies that led towards the Place Henri Quatre: the courtyard was not large enough to sufficiently turn a baker's cart around. Like several other homes in this aging town, the crookedness of the house made seem impossible to stand. As he went up the rickety staircase he had misgivings. The bedroom that was to be his was neat as a pin, and well furnished, and this eased his misgivings. He would be able to read and write as much as wanted without any disturbance for the length of his stay. He was sure that wonderful surprises would be in store for one surrounded by such grandeur!

A surprise came to him soon.

A slim hostess asked, "Will Monsieur like to be cooked for tonight?"

Being late as it was our bookman did not want to go out. He was also anxious to do a little exploring around his room before dark. If the hostess could prepare an omlette correctly, that would be delectible.
