I used to play chess a lot, however I no longer play because it doens't seem like a recreational activity for me anymore.  The game is no longer leisure, it is similiar to the concept of playing bar pool.  People go to a bar to have fun and play, yet there is always that one 'professional' that makes the game no longer fun.  Life is too short to take part in a game like this.  With that being said, sometimes not knowing how to play the game well is an advantage to you.  If you are good at the game, it is easy for people to know what your next move will be.  They are able to calculate your move ahead of time.  However, if you don't know how to play well, you will be unpredictable.  Much like a hunter does not expect a wild animal to charge at them.  It catches them off guard.  When I was young there was a boy I remember who could not be beat.  He challenged another young man.  I turned down the offer, in turn that made the chess player upset.  I gave in, and ended up playing.  Eventually I was able to get a checkmate.  The anger that flushed over him was terrible.  I refused to play again, I was afraid of what might happen.
