Notes on Marsh Miasm (Limnophysalis Hyalina) by Abr. Fredrik Eklund, M.D., Stockholm, Sweden.

[Translated from the Archives de la Medecine Navale, V. xxx, No. 7 (July 1978) by A. Sibley Campbell, M.D., Augusta, Georgia]

Prior to explaining the discovery of paludal miasma and its natural history, I wish to state that I have not had the opportunity to read or study Professor Salisbury's original treatise, but I am familiar with it via a resume published in an 1866 issue of the American Journal of Medical Sciences.

Initially, I was engaged in an investigation of microbes within the water and mud along the swampy shores of the marshes, including comparisons of the microphytes therein which might also be found in the urine of patients affected with fever. After three months, I discovered a connection, having taken samples of marsh slime along with kelp samples from the shore. Placed in natural, glass desiccators, I was able to find what I sought through a drop-by-drop examination of the evaporated water deposited in the desiccators.

The connection I discovered was the fever parasite (which I've named Limnophysalis hyalina) in the form of a fungus which develops from the mycelium. Each individual possesses one or more filaments, each extremely fine, plainly marked, hyaline, and pointed. Under conditions of moisture and heat (and decomposing vegetable matter), the filaments grow; fungus springs from the ends. The sporangia are composed of unilocular, transparent vesicles that rise from one or both sides of the parent filament, appearing as little buds stacked one upon the other along one side of the mycelium.

The sporangia have a transverse diameter of one to five millimenters (under a linear magnitude of 480). At the same magnitude, the mycelium filaments appear quite thin (finer than a hair).
