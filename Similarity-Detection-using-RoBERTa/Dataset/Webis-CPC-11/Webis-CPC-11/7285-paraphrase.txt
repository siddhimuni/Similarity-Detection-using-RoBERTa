Truthfully speaking, I am not capable to engage in a drama of interest a la Verre d'Eau; if there were the only way to engage me, I should pack my bags tomorrow and settle down in a German village; work I would do as much as I possibly could, but to sell my ware in this market is not feasible to me.  Artistic affairs here are in such a despicable state, so decaying, so fit for rot, that only a bold scytheman is needed who comprehends the right cut.

Dearest comrade, separate from all political speculation, I am coerced to mention publically that in the soil of the anti-Revolution no art can grow, neither may boe for the present in the soik of the Revolution, unless care were taken-in due time.  To mention briefly, tomorrow I will begin perusing for a article on the theatre of the future for some crucial, political journal.  I assure you to leave politics on one side as much as possible, and therefore will not meet you or anyone else halfway; but as far as art and the theatre are relevant, you must with a good grace, permit me to be as red as possible, for a very determined colour is the only one applicable to us.  This, I think, is my most reserved course to adopt, and he who suggests it for prudential reasons as the most effective one is none other than Bellloni, your representative.  He informs me that here I desire money as much as M. or actually more than M., or else I must make myself afraid.  Well, money I do not own, but a grand wanting to practice a little artistic terrorism.  Give me your blessing, or even more better yet, offer your assistance or help.
