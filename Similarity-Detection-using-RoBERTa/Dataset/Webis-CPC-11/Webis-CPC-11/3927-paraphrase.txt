Horny scales covering the bodies of animals has caused the last known for some time to be associated with reptiles, rather than the beasts, though they are perfectly true and mammals. Finally must be mentioned Aard-Varkala (Orycteropus) in South Africa.

All these creatures, from sloths to Aard-Varkala, are frequently associated together in an order which is called toothless.

Across mammalian orders listed yet agreed on some important details of their reproductive processes, and some smaller anatomical features, and all creatures in these orders are (and will) often spoke as placental mammals.

Only animals that remain to talk about two other commands are grouped.

The first of these is called the order Marsupialia, and includes all opossums (Didelphys), kangaroo (Macropus), phalangers (Phalangista), Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus) dasyures (Dasyurus), bandicoots (Perameles), and their allies. Except true opossums (Didelphys), all members of the order are in Australia or its vicinity, and nowhere else today, although, as we see better still, Europe has once gathered at the Australian Animal-to-day forms - especially a quadruped rather than generically named Myrmecobius.

As the last class of beasts, mammals have two very exceptional (both found only in the Australian region), duck-billed Platypus (Ornithorhynchus), and Echidna. The first of these, as the name suggests, has a pretty nose as a duck bill, with a short body, hairy, and short limbs. Echidna is covered with strong spines, dense, and has a long thin nose. These creatures form together to monotremes - an order which differs greatly from any order of mammals, more than any other orders of mammals differ from each other.
