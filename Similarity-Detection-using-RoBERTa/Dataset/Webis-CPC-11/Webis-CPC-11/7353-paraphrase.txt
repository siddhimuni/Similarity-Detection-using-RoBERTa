You have undoubtedly read about the early Christians who were persecuted and killed by rulers of Persia and other places.  Why are these really more worthy to be named as martyrs than others that have been killed for trying to save the world?  The Christian martyrs had to suffer all sorts of tortures.  The more who were killed, the more were people ready to join the cause so that from one killed there sprang up a hundred followers.

Once there were so many put to death that someone close to the king told him that the number of faithful was growing rather than diminishing.  The king didn't understand how that could be possible, but the courtier told him how double the number of martyrs were joining all the time.  There was even said to be a miraculous appearance of a man from heaven who would come to strengthen those just before death.
That's when the very king himself converted to christianity.  Many had arms and legs cut off or were burned for years to come.  No other faith seems to have had this much torture, especially that which was born with resignation and even with joy.  There's record of one Christian smiling even while being tortured.
