Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss Sallow is a near relation of mine
by marriage, and, as for her person, great allowance is to be made; for, let me tell you, a
woman labors under many disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl of six-and-thirty.

Lady Sneer. Though, surely, she is handsome still--and for the weakness in her eyes, considering
how much she reads by candlelight, it is not to be wondered at.

Mrs. Can. True, and then as to her manner; upon my word I think it is particularly graceful,
considering she never had the least education; for you know her mother was a Welsh milliner,
and her father a sugar-baker at Bristol.

Sir Ben. Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!

Sir Pet. Yes, distressingly good-natured!
