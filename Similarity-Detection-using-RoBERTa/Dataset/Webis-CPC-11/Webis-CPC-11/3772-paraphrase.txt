A thoughful friend, Grandpapa, left a forthnight before at Rittijavi and was waiting for us at Nyslott.  After the ship stopped at quayside in the early morning dawn light, he had arrived, accompanied by a man in a boat, one of those Finnish boats pointed at each end also known as a "Kuiru."

"Where are we to live?" we asked, over the side.

"In the Castle, if you lie," was his reply.  We were overjoyed at this prospect of anything so romatic, and we quickly transferred our baggage and ourselves into the boat below.

"I'm very anxious about this arrangement," one of your youthful old friend said.  "When I arrived at night, and found that there was not a room available to be had in town, I was depressed, after going from house to house.  I beseeched the hotel to take me in, but even their sofas were occupied.  I was determined not to leave Nyslott until I have seen this famous castle.  So, I got a boat and rowed across, Veni, vici, vidi- so I persuaded the watchman to put me up for a night and there I was to stay.  When I received a telegraphed that the town was full and I was only put up by the Vahtimestari of the Castle, you could only image my horror, when I got your reply--"Arriving at 4 A.M.  Arrange my stay at the Castle."

"Were you so much horrified?"  We laughed, we throught it would be such fun, and romatically delighful.

I felt utterly taken aback, and went off to consult an artist friend, who was painting the queer old place.  "It was not fun to me."
