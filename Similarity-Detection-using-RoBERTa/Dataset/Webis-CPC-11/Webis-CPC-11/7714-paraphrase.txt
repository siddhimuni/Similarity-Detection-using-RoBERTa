Space must towards be plus that list." 
"Did you notice something else approximately that letter-" Alhamid asked. "I mean, the very fact that he wrote a letter instead of telling you personally-" 

"Sure. He didn't believe me. He was concerned I, or person else, would dump of him whether we knew he knew our secret." 

"I think that's it," Alhamid agreed. "He needed towards be safely away first." 

"Killing him would possess carried down the biggest investigation the Earth Congress has launched since the crack-up of the Earth-Luna ship thirty years ago. Does he think we are fools-" 

"You can't blame him. He's been bred that distance, and three months of coaching isn't going towards distort him." 

St. Simon frowned. "Suppose he corrections his mind- Suppose he informs Tarnhorst what he thinks-" 

"He won't. He's told his lie, and already he'll possess towards stick via it or lose his precious security. If he couldn't sell that for freedom, he sure isn't going towards throw it away." Alhamid grinned. "But can you reckon a guy thinking that anchor background could be completely mechanized-" 

St. Simon grinned back. "I prediction I'm not a very nice teacher as soon as all. I told him and told him and told him for three solid months that the role required judgment, but it evidently didn't sink in. He's got the heart of a romantic and the soul of an Earthman--a very bad combination." 

"He has my sympathy," Alhamid remarked with feeling. "Now, approximately you. Your blue ticket still has three months towards operate, but I can't grant you a class whether you're alone going towards operate across the former halves of the course with them, and I don't possess any many Earthmen for you towards grant special tutoring to. You possess three choices: You can loaf with buy three months; you can go back towards space and get replicate buy three months; or you can rob a frequent six-month class and get replicate buy the last three months.
