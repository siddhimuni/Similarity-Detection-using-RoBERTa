ELIMINATION OF MINES

The correspondent of The London Times,wrote in his issue of March 20 as follows:

On Thursday, the further attack upon the inner forts at the Dardanelles, which was resumed by the allied squadrons made in loss of ships and gallant lives.

The operations which described the attributes of loss of the ships to floating mines,also released to drift down with the current in such large numbers of evading these machines was not available.

Precaution steps has to be taken like movement of the battleships to avoid this danger, this area having been swept of anchored mines.

The ships maintained their superiority over the forts and succeeded in silencing them after a few hours bombardment.The battleships sinked in the later afternoon when naval force was making advance to cover the mine sweeping operations. In this work nothing was eventual sucees nor the defence proved formidable than expected.
