In April the southerly winds make their entrance on this coast,
bringing in the wet season, with violent tornados, thunder and lightning, and much rain. In
September the other coasting trade at east-north-east comes in and clears the sky, bringing
fair weather. This, as to the change of wind, is what I have observed, but as to the change
of weather accompanying it so exactly here at Bahia this is a particular exception to what
I have experienced in all other places of south latitudes that I have been in between the tropics,
or those I have heard of; for there the dry season sets in, in April, and the wet about October
or November, sooner or later (as I have said that they are, in south latitudes, the reverse
of the seasons, or weather, in the same months in north latitudes, whereas on this coast of
Brazil the wet season comes in in April at the same time that it doth in north latitudes, and
the dry (as I have said here) in September; the rains here not lasting so far in the year as
in other places; for in September the weather is usually so fair that in the latter part of
that month they begin to cut their sugarcane here, as I was told; for I enquired particularly
about the seasons: though this, as to the season of cutting of cane, which I was now assured
to be in September, agrees not very well with that I was formerly told, that in Brazil they
cut the cane in July.
