In 1884 Mr. William Woodall tried again; he lost also, largely through the efforts of Gladstone;
and the same statesman was instrumental in killing another bill in 1892, when Mr. A.J. Balfour
urged its passage.

At the present day women in England cannot vote on great questions of universal state policy
nor can they hold great offices of state. Yet their gains have been enormous, as I shall next
demonstrate; and in this connection I shall also glance briefly at their vast strides in the
colonies.

In 1850 Ontario gave all women school suffrage. In 1867 New South Wales gave them municipal
suffrage. In 1869 England granted municipal suffrage to single women and widows; Victoria gave
it to all women, married or single. In England in 1870 the Education Act, by which school boards
were created, gave women the same rights as men, both as regards electing and being elected.
In 1871 West Australia gave them municipal suffrage; in 1878 New Zealand gave school suffrage.
In 1880 South Australia gave municipal suffrage. In 1881 widows and single women obtained municipal
suffrage in Scotland and Parliamentary suffrage on the Isle of Man. Municipal suffrage was
given by Ontario and Tasmania in 1884 and by New Zealand and New Brunswick in 1886; by Nova
Scotia and Manitoba in 1887. In 1888 England gave women county suffrage and British Columbia
and the North-West Territory gave them municipal suffrage. In 1889 county suffrage was given
the women of Scotland and municipal suffrage to single women and widows in the Province of
Quebec. In 1893 New Zealand gave full suffrage. In 1894 parish and district suffrage was given
in England to women married and single, with power to elect and to be elected to parish and
district councils. In 1895 South Australia gave full state suffrage to all women. In 1898 the
women of Ireland were given the right to vote for all officers except members of Parliament.
In 1900 West Australia granted full state suffrage to all. In 1902 full national suffrage was
given all the women in federated Australia and full state suffrage to those of New South Wales.
In 1903 Tasmania gave full state suffrage; in 1905 Queensland did the same; in 1908 Victoria
followed. In 1907 England made women eligible as mayors, aldermen, and county and town councillors.
In London, for example, at the present time women can vote for the 28 borough councils and
31 boards of guardians of the London City Council; they can also be themselves elected to these;
be members of the central unemployed body or of the 23 district committees, and can be co-opted
to all other bodies, like the local pension committees. Women can be aldermen of the Council;
and there is nothing to prevent one from holding even the office of chairman.

At the present moment the cause of woman suffrage in England is being furthered chiefly by
two organizations which differ in methods. The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies
has adopted the "constitutional" or peaceful policy; but the National Women's Social and Political
Union is "militant" and coercive.
