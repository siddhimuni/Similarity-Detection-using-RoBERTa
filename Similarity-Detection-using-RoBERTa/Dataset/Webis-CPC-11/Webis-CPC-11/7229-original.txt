RITA (from within): Well? 

 What's the matter? 

 BERTHA (at the door): Oh, this gentleman here--he wishes to see you very much. He is passing through here. 

 RITA (within; laughs): Come in. 

 (Bertha disappears.) 

 (Friedrich has walked up to the middle door, where he remains standing.) 

 RITA: Well. Who is it? Friedrich---- Hmm---- I shall come immediately. 

 BERTHA (comes out and looks at Friedrich in surprise): My lady wishes you to await her. (She walks away, after having taken another glance at Friedrich.) 

 (Friedrich looks about embarrassed and shyly.) 

 (Rita enters attired in a tasteful dressing gown, but remains standing in the door.) 

 FRIEDRICH (bows; softly): Good day. 

 (Rita looks at him with an ironical smile and remains silent.) 

 FRIEDRICH: You remember me?
