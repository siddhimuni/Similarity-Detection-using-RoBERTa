Distribution and Geographic Variation

Lasiurus intermedius H. Allen, type from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, has been reported from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas southward to Honduras and in Cuba. Lasiurus floridanus (Miller), type from Lake Kissimmee, Florida, has been recorded from southeastern Texas, eastward along the Gulf of Mexico to Florida, and thence northward along the Atlantic Coast to extreme southeastern Virginia (see records of occurrence beyond and Fig. 2). Specimens of intermedius from the vicinity of the type locality and from other localities in MÃ©xico differ from specimens of floridanus (from Florida and southern Georgia) as follows: Larger, both externally (especially forearm) and cranially (see measurements); teeth larger and heavier; skull heavier and having more prominent sagittal and lambdoidal crests; braincase less rounded, more elongate; auditory bullae relatively smaller; upper parts averaging brighter (yellowish to yellowish-orange in general aspect, rather than yellowish-brown to brownish-gray).

The differences mentioned above are of the magnitude of those that ordinarily separate subspecies of a single species rather than two species. Miller (1902:392-393), in the original description of floridanus, noted that the differences between it and intermedius were slight and remarked (p. 393)
