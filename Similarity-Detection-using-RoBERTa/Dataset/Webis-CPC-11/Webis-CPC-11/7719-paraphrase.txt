The chinking was all grey-blue river mud, packed and dried. The cabin's windows were called 'chinkins' and the roof was made of bark strips laid one over the other like shingles. The floor was laid with split logs, which were superior to bark or dirt.

I liked watching carts come groaning up from the Red River piled high with furs, their drivers ambling lazily alongside scrappy little oxen. Every once in a while, I'd see a cow pulling a cart instead -- and once, a buffalo calf trailing along after them. I wondered if it was the cow's weanling -- a cataloo, maybe, or a buffow.

The year I turned nine, my father sent me to fetch a bucket of water from the spring. As I was coming back, bucket sloshing, I heard him call my name. Hastening my step, I found myself abruptly surrounded by a band of Indians. They wanted my bucket but I would not let them have it, and they were amused by my pluck. The chief traveling with them, a warrior by the name of Little Crow, ordered me to give it to them too, but I said, "No, my father asked me to bring this for him. You can't have it."

They laughed. Little Crow called me 'tonka squaw,' which I learned meant 'brave woman,' and they left. Later, my father told me that they must have been on their way to a ceremonial dance in Shakopee. He knew by their fanciful attire -- warbonnets, paints, chest pieces, and so on -- and told me that if they had actually been out to war, they would have been wearing almost nothing at all.

In 1843, I saw my first American soldiers. They were from Fort Snelling and wore blue woolen uniforms with brass buttons. They had tall, blue woolen caps with leather bridles around the brim as well, and they used to take them off when they visited DeNoyer's for dinner and a change of pace.
