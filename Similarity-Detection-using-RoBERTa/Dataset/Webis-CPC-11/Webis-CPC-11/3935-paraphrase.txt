It is very easy towards evolve them successfully.  Bulbs intended for dip flowering, should be planted within the open ground from the former towards the middle of May; plant them approximately two inches deep. They shall do well within any nice, rich garden soil, whether the soil is occasionally transported round them with the rake or hoe, as soon as they are up and growing. Such counseling shall inflict the bulbs towards evolve rapidly, and the flower trusses, when they arrive into bloom, shall therefore be much taller and finer. As the Tuberose is not hardy within our Northern climates, the bulbs should be dug up within the dip, the tops or stalks swept towards within two or three inches of the bulbs, which should otherwise be laid away within a number of dry, warm site, a dry and frost-proof cellar shall do, or better yet, stock them whether possible, below the staging of a green-house. In the spring, ahead of planting, get rid of everybody the young offsets from round the parent bulb; there are habitually a number of young shoots clinging towards it, and as the old bulb flowers but once, and alone once, it is henceforth nice for nothing, retain for the production of many bulbs, whether desired. The young offshoots of the former season's increases shall not become flowering bulbs until the third year, but whether you possess relatively a number of young bulbs, say twenty-five or fifty, there shall naturally be a number that shall bloom within rotation, from year towards year, and grant a number of bloom each season. Some enterprising florists possess Tuberoses nearly the complete year round. In order towards do this, the bulbs ought be "started" within pots; the bulbs are potted within the habitual method, so that the top, or crown of the bulb, when potted, shall just appear above the soil, and they should be kept rather dry until they appear signs of evolving, when they can be watered freely and predetermined within a warm place. Of course bulbs intended for winter flowering ought lie down, or be kept from evolving during the summer, and bulbs towards be within bloom within April or May, ought be activated within January or February within pots
