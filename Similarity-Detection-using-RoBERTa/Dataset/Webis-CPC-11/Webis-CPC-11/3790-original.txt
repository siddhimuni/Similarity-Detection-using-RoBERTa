There is a superb
"Reverie Poétique." It is that climax of success, a scholarly inspiration. To the meagre body
of American scherzos, Bartlett's scherzo will be very welcome. It is very festive and very
original. Its richly harmonized interlude shows a complete emancipation from the overpowering
influence of Chopin, and a great gain in strength as well as individuality.

In his songs Bartlett attains a quality uniformly higher than that of his piano pieces. "Moonbeams"
has many delicacies of harmony. "Laughing Eyes" is a fitting setting of Mr. "Nym Crinkle" Wheeler's
exquisite lyric. "Come to Me, Dearest," while cheap in general design, has fine details.

It makes me great dole to have to praise a song about a brooklet; but the truth is, that Bartlett's
"I Hear the Brooklet's Murmur" is superbly beautiful, wild with regret,--a noble song. It represents
the late German type of Lied, as the earlier heavy style is exemplified in "Good Night, Dear
One." Very Teutonic also is the airiness and grace of "Rosebud."

To that delightful collection of children's songs, "The St. Nicholas Song Book," Bartlett contributed
largely. All of his lyrics are delicious, and "I Had a Little Pony" should become a nursery
classic.

In his "Lord God, Hear My Prayer," Bartlett throws down the gauntlet to the Bach-Gounod "Ave
Maria," with results rather disastrous. He chooses a Cramer étude, and adds to it parts for
voice, violin, and organ. While Gounod seems passionate and unrestrained, Bartlett shows his
caution and his cage at every step.
