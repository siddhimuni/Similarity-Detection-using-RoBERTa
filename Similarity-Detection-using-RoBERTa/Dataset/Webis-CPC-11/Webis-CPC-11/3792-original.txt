Besides the resident professors, it has been the policy of the University to enlist from time
to time the services of distinguished scholars as lecturers on those subjects to which their
studies have been particularly directed. During the first few years the number of such lecturers
was larger, and the duration of their visits was longer than it has been recently. When the
faculty was small, the need of the occasional lecturer was more apparent for obvious reasons,
than it has been in later days. Still the University continues to invite the cooperation of
non-resident professors, and the proximity of Baltimore to Washington makes it particularly
easy to engage learned gentlemen from the capital to give occasional lectures upon their favorite
studies. Recently a lectureship of Poetry has been founded by Mr. and Mrs. Turnbull of Baltimore,
in memory of a son who is no longer living, and an annual course may be expected from writers
of distinction who are known either as poets, or as critics, or as historians of poetry. The
first lecturer on this foundation will be Mr. E.C. Stedman, of New York, the second, Professor
Jebb, of Cambridge (Eng.). Another lectureship has been instituted by Mr. Eugene Levering with
the object of promoting the purposes of the Young Men's Christian Association. The first lecturer
on this foundation was Rev. Dr. Broadus, of Louisville, Ky.

A few of those who held the position of lecturers made Baltimore their home for such prolonged
periods that they could not properly be called non-resident.
