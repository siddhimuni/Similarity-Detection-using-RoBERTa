"Then everything is still the same," said Isabel proudly, almost forgetting that the major was still there until he spoke again, this time in a sharp and passionate voice. 

She realized that he was serious, even more so than Cabarreux had been when he expressed his love for her that day. "Miss Calhoun, do you remember the day three or four years ago when I was knocked down in a drunken brawl and left lying like a dog in the street?" 

"Major Fetridge..."

"No, I need to tell you this. You were just a child then, but you tried to help me up and take me home. When you couldn't, you covered my face with your handkerchief. Look, I still have it, such a small thing!" He opened it to show her.

"Anyone would have done the same thing. Why are you bringing this up now?" cried Isabel.

"That day I swore before Almighty God that when I achieved success in my life I would ask you to be my wife. I haven't always been Sam Fetridge, the drunken bum. I have great potential and you have seen it in me. I know it by the way you have always treated me."

She could tell from his words and the way he spoke that he was a man of intelligence and vitality, that she could possibly love. Nevertheless, all she could see before her was Sam Fetridge, the laughingstock of the village.

"I know you have had a hard life in Sevier," she said,  "and I will do anything I can to help you change it."

"Don't you understand what I'm saying?" he said as he took her hands in his, with tears in his eyes. She gazed at him steadily without removing her hands. "Tonight is a turning point for me, Miss Calhoun. I have loved you for a long time and with you I could be a better man. I feel that I have a right to ask you to be my wife."
