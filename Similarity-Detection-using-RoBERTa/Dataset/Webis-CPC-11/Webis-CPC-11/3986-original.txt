"Will he not waken again?" said Pharaoh. "If two pray together, will Love refuse their prayer?"

"It might be so," she said, "if two prayed together; for if they prayed, he would have heard
already!"

"Meriamun," said the Pharaoh eagerly, for he thought her heart was moved by pity and sorrow,
"once thou didst win my crown at the Pieces, wilt thou play me for thy love?"

She thought for one moment, and then she said:

"Yes, I will play thee, my Lord, but my hand has lost its cunning, and it may well be that
Meriamun shall lose again, as she has lost all. Let me set the Pieces, and bring wine for my lord."

She set the Pieces, and crossing the room, she lifted a great cup of wine, and put it by Pharaoh's
hand. But he was so intent on the game that he did not drink.

He took the field, he moved, she replied, and so the game went between them, in the dark fragrant
chamber where the lamp burned, and the Queen's eyes shone in the night. This way and that went
the game, till she lost, and he swept the board.

Then in triumph he drained the poisoned cup of wine, and cried, "Pharaoh is dead!"

"Pharaoh is dead!" answered Meriamun, gazing into his eyes.

"What is that look in thine eyes, Meriamun, what is that look in thine eyes?"

And the King grew pale as the dead, for he had seen that look before--when Meriamun slew Hataska.

"Pharaoh is dead!" she shrilled in the tone of women who wail the dirges. "Pharaoh, great Pharaoh
is dead! Ere a man may count a hundred thy days are numbered. Strange! but to-morrow, Meneptah,
shalt thou sit where Hataska sat, dead on the knees of Death, an Osirian in the lap of the
Osiris. Die, Pharaoh, die! But while thy diest, hearken. There is one I love, the Wanderer
who leads thy hosts. His love I stole by arts known to me, and because I stole it he would
have shamed me, and I accused him falsely in the ears of men. But he comes again, and, so sure
as thou shalt sit on the knees of Osiris, so surely shall he sit upon thy throne, Pharaoh.
