Mr. Toppel. I believe that we need to congratulate ourselves on the success that we have had now that we have the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, and the President of the Divorce Division, securely locked up together in the attic. I believe that we agree that there was no other way except for that of imitating our Sicilian brethren of the robe, and take to a little mild brigandage, considering the awful decay of legal business and our own destitute condition. (Sympathetic cries of Hear, hear! from the Chancery Barrister, and the two Starving Juniors.) I strongly believe that by suffering some hours in the attic the High Legal Dignitaries will be obligued to accept our demands. At the same time, I suggest that these sixteen gentlemen shoud go to the Pirate Bus' which is already waiting for them, and see if the Master of the Rolls could allow himself to make any trouble while proceeding to his Court. It probably would be best, since Lord ESHER belongs to the Equity side, that our friend here of the Chancery Bar to place him in his Chambers.

Chancery Barrister (visibly worried). But I do not have room for him!

Mr. Toppel (slowly). Just a small basement will do pretty well. (To the sixteen Masked Men). Lord ESHER is to be found somewhere about Chancery Lane. Tell him convincingly that his fee will be a thousand guineas.

First Junior. I just went upstairs to see what our prisoners were doing. The CHANCELLOR was unhappy with the conditions and wanted something more suitable to his status. He was very sensitive about it; so I had to gag him again.

Mr. Toppel. Right. You could have told him perpahs that we will cut his body and send little pieces of it to his own friends if he refuses the conditions which we offer him. How does the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE bear it?

Second Junior. Not good.
