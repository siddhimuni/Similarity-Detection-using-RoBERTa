This was the way these causes worked. (I wish I could use the word “thusly”—it’s fun to say.)

Since he wasn’t from around here, Dr. Hicok didn’t have the same moral code of someone who was born in America, so he was easy to convince to do immoral things. He was from Scotland, so he was really conceited and thought he was great at metaphysics, logic, and dialectics. He called these things “dialektik”—I guess he thought trying to sound German would make him sound smart. Scottish people are okay at logic and dialectics, but, ironically, they tend to be both rotten at metaphysics and convinced that they’re great at them. Don’t waste your time trying to convince them otherwise--not because God says you shouldn't, but because it's hopeless to try.

Dr. Hicok was also a doctor and a surgeon, and medical professionals tend to be either materialists or extreme, loud Calvinistic Presbyterians. On top of this, they’re stubborn, brassy, and sure of themselves (as they need to be to be good doctors.)

So Hicok thought he had a personal problem, and was utterly convinced he could outsmart and defeat it on his own. Unfortunately, things didn’t go the way he had planned. The doctor wasn’t very intimidating—he had graying, thin hair, freckles, tiny beady eyes, and goofy-looking white eyelashes and eyebrows as though he’d just spilled flour all over his kitchen when the ceiling fan was on.
