If one has to emphasize the final syllable with an accent, though it is technically correct in English to put it there, it isn't really smart to do that, since the listeners will be made to hear an odd exclamation instead of paying attention the point of the service. It's actually better to append the accent to the second last in two-syllable words, the third-last in three-syllable words, which are acutitones in the original Greek. A wrong and rather bookish custom came up of stressing every second last syllable, which was believed to be super long in Greek.

This contributes to the pretty recent habit of pronouncing [Greek: Sabaôth], [Greek: Zaboulôn], [Greek: sabachthani], [Greek: Akeldama] with a super long stress on the second last, when the traditional way of stressing the third last draws no attention and is actually closer to the real way to say it.

Some funny wavering exists in the normal way to read in English (Greek: Samareia) and (Greek: Kaisareia). The first is definitely Grecian, but it's normal in this instance to accent the second last word. I never say anybody who said out loud Sabaoth, Zabulon and sabachtani do the same with Samaria or Cesarea. The two seem to make sense in Greek with the tonic accents of Hebrew, as experts in that language will state.

E. C. H.  This is what I think is the correct way of saying these things as they're supposed to be said.

Read the vowels like in Italian, the hh the way one says the end of Bach in German, and the th like in English.

Sabaoth = ts[)i]-v[=a]-['=o]th.

Hebrew. [The] Moriah = [h[)a]m-]m['=o]-r[=i]-y['=a]h. Syriac. Aceldama = hh[)i]-k[')a]l-d[)i]-m['=a].

Syro-Chaldee. Eli Eli lamma sabachthani = [=e]-l['=i] [=e]l['=i] l[)a]m-m['=a] s[)a]-b[')a]hh-t[)a]-n['=i], as in Matthew; or [)e]-l['=o]-h[=i], as in Mark.
