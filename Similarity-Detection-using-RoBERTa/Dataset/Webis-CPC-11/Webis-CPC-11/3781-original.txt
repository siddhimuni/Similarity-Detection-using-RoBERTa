Nevertheless if people upon whom the star of good fortune has shone are in attendance
at private assemblies and receive permission to be seated, they may perform the prostration
of gratitude by bowing their foreheads to the earth and so share in the rays of good fortune.
So forbidding prostration to the people at large and granting it to the select the Emperor
fulfils the wishes of both and gives the world an example of practical wisdom."

The desire to unite his subjects as much as possible finally impelled Akbar to the attempt
to equalize religious differences as well. Convinced that religions did not differ from each
other in their innermost essence, he combined what in his opinion were the essential elements
and about the year 1580 founded a new religion, the famous Dîn i Ilâhi, the "religion of God."
This religion recognizes only one God, a purely spiritual universally efficient being from
whom the human soul is derived and towards which it tends. The ethics of this religion comprises
the high moral requirements of Sufism and Parsism: complete toleration, equality of rights
among all men, purity in thought, word and deed. The demand of monogamy, too, was added later.
Priests, images and temples,--Akbar would have none of these in his new religion, but from
the Parsees he took the worship of the fire and of the sun as to him light and its heat seemed
the most beautiful symbol of the divine spirit.[44] He also adopted the holy cord of the Hindus
and wore upon his forehead the colored token customary among them.
