    I was much delighted to watch the  movements of mules  as I am fond of their characterstics . They hop  like frogs through the mud while dragging the army wagon.  Their nicely trimmed tail, perked up ears and small feet all give it sweet look.The mules are really hardworking, always tugging with its might even pulling away even the others stopped. The food for the entire army is brought in by the hardwork of these mules. The historic mules are an model for the humanity.
