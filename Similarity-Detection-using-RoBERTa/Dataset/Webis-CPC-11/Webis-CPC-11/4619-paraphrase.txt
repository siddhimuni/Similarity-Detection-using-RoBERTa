One of the most audacious fights of the war took place here. I had two companies of my Northamptons occupying a tiny house with surrounding orchard beside the railroad line. We had thrown up a hurried earthwork and placed rails along the top of the parapet. 

Soon after finishing our earthwork we were attacked by an estimated 500 Boers with one or possibly two field guns. Our small garrison lined our small trenches and managed to keep the enemy off for several hours. However, had some artillery reinforcements not come up the line to our assistance the fight would have fared quite badly for my Northamptons. The Boers were forced to withdrawn with some losses.

On Decemeber 10th we were delayed at Enslin by an accident. I looked carefully at the position that we held during the minor engagement at the orchard. The leaves from the trees were bullet ridden, the trunks and house torn to shreds from Mauser bullets. Even a corner of the earthworks had been torn away by a shell. Yet out of my two companies there was only 8 casualties!

It is the same story over again. The same has happened to the Boers. Troops that are entrenched behind earthworks can have shell fire rain upon them but yet if the shells enfilades, it does not kill the men in the trenches.

Near the river Modder whose real name is the Riet we had a few officers who decided to fish. The stream itself is not impressive. The waters are yellow and muddy and the vegetation that line the banks are thin and overall rather scrappy. The only fish the officers managed to catch were likewise just as scrappy as the vegetation along its banks. Even with the poor quality of our camp rations there wasn't a single one of us that decided to eat from the catch of scrappy fish, due to the fact of the good many dead Boers that we had dragged out of the water.
