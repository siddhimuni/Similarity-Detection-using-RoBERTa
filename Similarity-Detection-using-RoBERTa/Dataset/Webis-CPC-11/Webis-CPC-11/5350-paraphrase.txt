This was a glorious time when those who lived in heaven came to earth to chat with humans.  Love and Joy were the children of Jupiter and when they came to earth blossoms grew where they walked, the sun shone brightly, and everything in nature seemed to grow better.  Jupiter was happy that they were forging a lasting union and wanted them to marry as soon as they were old enough.  But people were misbehaving and   sinning, so the gods left, except for Love, who had been brought to the  Arcadian forest by Hope.
So Jupiter thought he should marry Sorrow instead and he reluctantly agreed because she had sunken eyes, a perpetually wrinkled face, and a wormwood and cypress wreath on her head.
A virgin was born to them with a sad but pleasing face, a combination of mother and father.  She was named Pity. She was so gentle that birds took refuge at her breast and her sweet voice called to them and to nature as she languished near streams and taught people how to weep.  Her tears fell into the streams and from that water the muses took their inspiration.  Jupiter asked that she, like her mother, comfort those in sorrow and this she did.  But she was not a heavenly immortal and so, like her mother, would die.  Jupiter decreed that when she would die, Love would once more be able to marry Joy as was intended from all of time and all would be happy again.

I was traveling on the left bank between Remagan and Andernach when I decided to check to see about similar volcanic formations in the center of France.  I went 16 miles to Brohl, where the Rhine valley narrows, and there found an interesting terrain.  Sometimes it is covered in vegetation, sometimes there is none.  Even when there is green growth, it is short and not always evocative of lushness.
