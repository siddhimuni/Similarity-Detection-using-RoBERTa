In a publicaiton, its altered form in 1773 had the effect of a bomb on the literary public of Germany.  It sent a shudder of horor through the stcklers for the rules of the classical drama which it ignored with such contemptuous indifference.  A shudder of delight through a band of effervescing youghs who shared Goethe's revoluntionary ideas, and to who Gotz was a manifesto and a challenge to all traditional conventions in literature and life.  It was the immediate parent of the truly german growth-the literature of Sturm un Dang.  Exponents says, Kant thought that they could not more effectively show that they were budding geniuses than flinging all rules to the winds and that one appears to be at a better advantage on the spavined hack that on a trained steed.  The literatuer of Strum un Drang was a passing phenomenon, but the influences of Gotz did not end with its abortive life.  Gortz Schiller's very early productions would have been differently inspired.  But due to Gotz much of the inspiration of the subsequent German Romatic School, through many of its developments were abhorrent to Goethe's nature both in youth and maturity.  It emancipated the drama from conventional shackles.  It extended the range of national though, sentiment, emotion and for good and evil introduced now elements into German literature which hae maintained their place there since its first portentious appearance.  German critics are unanimous in assigning another result to the publication of Gotz.  In its style as in its form it set convention at naught, and thus marks an epoch in the development of German literary language.  Not since Luther, "whose words were battles," had German been written with so much directness from the heart and with such elemental force as makes words living things.

It has been a commonplace remark that in 1773, the year of the publication of Gotz, corresponds in European literature to 1789 in European political history.
