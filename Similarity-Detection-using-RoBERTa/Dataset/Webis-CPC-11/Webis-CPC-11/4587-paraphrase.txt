Afterwards we rode for four hours through the heavily populated country; but, being guided as we were by a Dervish, we avoided the populated places. Now we began to journey up into the majestic and picturesque mountains, and reached the mountain snow in two hours. Up here there are only fir trees resting in snow, their tops partially exposed. The cold here is extreme; and, remarkably, the pullets' eggs we acquired in the country just hours ago were almost double the size of the European variants. Another two hours 76 further, we came to a pass, a narrow one at that, with an inaccessible mountain covered with snow on the east and a mile-long drop to the west. It was as if the mountain had been torn into two by some intense act of nature. The pass was barely a foot wide and beneath our feet was solid granite. The entire force dismounted here, many of them to pray; but, even so, two mules fell into the deep precipice along with what they were carrying. There are only two passes into the district of Suse, which was once its own sovereign state, allowing it to be easily defended from within the pass. Heading north through the pass, we advanced another seven hours (now descending towards the plains of a large town named Fruga almost fifteen miles from the mountains). Continuing another two hours, the army made camp on broad, level land on the slight slope at the northern end of Atlas. Here, there was a large plantation of olives to the west of Ait 77 Musie, a plenteous and romantic country.
