THE MEASUREMENT FOR CYANIDE AND SILVER NITRATE VIA TITRATION.

The measure of the amount of a cyanide is determined by calculating the amount of silver nitrate needed to transform the entirety of the cyanide into either potassium silver cyanide [39] or an allied compound. The equation demonstrates that for 130 parts by weight potassium cyanide requires 170 parts by weight silver nitrate. As previously discussed, the usual practice is to measure cyanide-strength in relation to potassium cyanide, even if just sodium salt is apparent. A one-gram measurement of potassium cyanide needs 1.3076 gram silver nitrate. The basic mixture of silver nitrate is created by adding 13.076 grams of it to distilled water with a 1 liter dilution; the solution equals 1 gram of potassium cyanide [40] for every 100 c.c.'s.  

The titration is created in the standard manner, mixing the typical silver nitrate solution into one which has an understood volume or weight of the cyanide-containing solution. The concluding point is measured in two possible ways; both methods are equally popular. Number one, if the solution has any remaining cyanide in it, it will join forces with the silver nitrate to create double cyanide and, as a result, an opaque solution. However, the instant the remaining cyanide is depleted, silver nitrate will form silver cyanide through its interaction with the double cyanide [41]. The solution splits as a white precipitate and becomes turbid. For number two, however, if potassium iodide exists in the solution, it will cause a reaction in the leftover silver nitrate [42] as opposed to the double cyanide. Separation will occur and the silver iodide will exhibit easily-observed yellow turbidity.
