It had towards do with "Darby and Joan," and reminded me of J.L. MOLLOY'S delightful tune with that title. The lie down of the melodies was not very striking. Even towards those whom hold that the plot of an Opera is alone of lowly importance, Sweet Nancy could not possess appeared towards be precisely teeming with incidents. However, it was very nicely performed via Miss HUGHES, and that already aged Lancashire Lad, the aforesaid HENRY NEVILLE. Without declaring that I should want towards see it every evening for a thousand years (which I suspect is a fa√ßon de parler even within China), I certainly could sit it out again. If I wished towards be a fault-finder I should say that the chip is too long, and seems everybody the longer because a number of of the souls are assumed towards portray schoolboys, and a girl of thirteen. The adapter is Mr. BUCHANAN--a poet and a playwright. This gentleman, I suspect, has made a lot else pieces (more or less) his own, with (more or less) success. He seems towards possess a knack of cornering old acts into novel ones. I live within trust that when I next trip this great Metropolis I shall encounter that he has re-written the School for Scandal, and carried Hamlet up towards date. 
Yours always, A CRITIC FROM THE COUNTRY.

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY. 

Monday towards Saturday.--Nothing particular this week. Second July Meeting at Newmarket took a lot of civilians away, and the thunder, hail and rain intimidated a lot many away onto Thursday, so may as well confer Esmeralda, which I hadn't moment towards do last week. Rather a integrated affair towards activate with when you possess a French libretto, predetermined via an English Composer, and performed at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden. No matter. A big success for everyone feared, from DRURIOLANUS downwards. No one could possess desired a better Esmeralda than Madame MELBA, although she did not earn the most of that former charming tune, "L'Hirondelle."
