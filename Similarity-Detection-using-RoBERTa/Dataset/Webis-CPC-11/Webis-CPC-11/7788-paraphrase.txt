You say that the vidence of our press and public speakers has rigteous indignation against slavery which once kindled in all English hears was waned. If it has not died out and you believe that we want generous face and sympathy for the North during her great struggle, but have only descended to afford countenance and not assistence for the South, it means nothing! More than enough debate has already been held on the complicated motives blending in your war in human concerns and occasional acts of questionable spirits, which attend the public policy and sentiments of a nation involved in the deadliest conflict and bleeding at every pore. You may, perhaps, somewhat forgive those who have withheld their full sympathies, maybe feeling jealous that most righteous causes should be maintained with any except the most untainted motives and unbending rectitude and who have failed to even read your policy the full desire to accomplish the end of universal emancipation. Providedence is visibly directing the course of events and might be forgiven by those who have been mis led by the misrepresenttations of a portion of our press which might have been missled by the inimical spirit of your own.Oh, Madam, even though my lips have been closed which should have spoken beautiful words of blessing, a voice of England has reached you and has lacked that full tone of heartfelt sympathy. Even though you anticipated them, I do not believe that our nation is truly alienated from yours or apostate to the great principles of freedom which were once our pride and glory.
