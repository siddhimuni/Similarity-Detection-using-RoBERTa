When accosted never
stop, never draw out watch or box of lights, and never know the way anywhere. Always make a
good guess at the time, and swear you have no matches about you. It is wonderful to notice
kind-hearted ladies stopping to give to stalwart beggars who are only waiting for an opportunity
to snatch purses, and it would be interesting to know how many annually lose their purses and
watches through this mistaken method of distributing largess.

Let me conclude by saying that, if you want to be as safe as possible in a doubtful neighbourhood,
your best friends are a quick ear, a quick eye, a quick step, and a predilection for the middle
of the road. The two former help you to detect, as the two latter may enable you to avoid a
sudden onslaught.

  INNS OF COURT SCHOOL OF ARMS, WINNER OF THE MIDDLE WEIGHTS,
  CAMBRIDGE, 1876-7; HEAVY WEIGHTS, 1877-8.

"Mr. Winn's book is worthy of great praise, for it is at once one of the cheapest and best
on the subject."--Field.

"His (Mr. Allanson-Winn's) book gives ample testimony of his ability to write on boxing. If
only for the illustrations that enable the novice to see what he should do with the gloves
and what he should not do with them, the brochure is well worth the modest price charged for
it."--PENDRAGON in the Referee.

"The art of self-defence is here treated from a thoroughly practical point of view. Clear as
the text is, its value is no little enhanced by the numerous and admirably executed illustrations."--St.
James's Gazette.
