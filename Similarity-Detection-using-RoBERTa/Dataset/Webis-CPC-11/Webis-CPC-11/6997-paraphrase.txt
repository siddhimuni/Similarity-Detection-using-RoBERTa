For the confused, Mr. Mansel of St. John's College, Oxon explained the paradox of "Achilles and the Tortoise" (Achilles and the Tortoise, Vol. ii, p. 154) in a note in the late edition of Aldrich's Logic (p. 125, 1849).

In the note, Mansel shows the fallacy in the paradox is a material one, in that it is a false assumption of the major premise, i.e., that the sum of an infinite series is always infinite. Rather, such a sum may be finite.

To support his note, Mansel refers to p. 128 of Plato, Parmenid. [failing, of course, to specify the edition used]

Stepony Ale (p. 267, Vol. ii)-- The Chamberlayne extract must be a reference to the ale made at Stepney. It is similar to other references. For instance, in Playford's compilation of popular old tunes, the English Dancing Master, 1721, there is one called "Stepney Ale and Cakes." Another example can be found in the works of Tom Brown and Ned Ward, which also make allusions to "Stepney Ale and Cakes."

It is not possible for all to have disappeared if they ever coined any.

Wormwood (pp. 249, 315, Vol. ii.) Crême d'Absinthe, and Vermouthe are two types of liqueur flavoured with wormwood that are used by the French gourmands. Vermouthe is flatteringly called a coup d'après in the Almanac des Gourmands. It is said, I believe, in the south of France, that it is the fashion to have girls bring a glass of Vermouthe towards the end of the meal to resettle the stomach.
