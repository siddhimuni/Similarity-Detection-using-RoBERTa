The colourless granules found in Florideae with a composition of carbohydrate reserve material, shall be called as the floridean-starch.Usually found with a white efflorescence on a certain kind of Brown Algae(Saccorhiza bulbosa, Laminaria saccharina), when allowed to dry in the air, contains Mannite.The cell-sap of Acetabularia can be termen as Mucin. Proteid crystalloids which can be commonly found around Florideae are risen by a kind of Siphonales.

Tannin can be the main reason for the presence of abundant freshwater algae

Colouring Matters.

Presence of chrolophyll feeds the alge with carbonic acid gas during day time.

Phycocyanin, Phycophaein and Phycoerythrin influences and modifies the absorption spectra in the plants.In the case of phycoerythrin the major part of absorption, apart from the great absorption at the blue end of the spectrum, is not,while chlorophyll is found alone, near the Fraunhofer line B, but farther to the right beyond the line D. Engelmann's method traced the greatest liberation of oxygen, and assimilation of carbon, which occurs in the spectrum which is situated to the right of the absorption bands.

The penetration power of light into the clear sea varies with respect to different colour ratios.

Which clearly shows reduced red light is the reason for the lower growth rate approximately around 34 meters below the mean sea level, and yellow light constitutes a depth of 177 metres and green light at 322 metres.
