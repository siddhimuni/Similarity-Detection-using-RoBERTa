Based on what you see in the media and hear from public figures, you say that the justified anti-slavery sentiments that were present in the English psyche have faded, maybe even disappeared. You also claim that we haven't been sensitive and attentive enough to the Northern faction's needs, and, further, that we have tacitly approved, if not outright supported the Southern faction. At this point, there has been more than sufficient argumentation on the subject of the complex motivations that led to this conflict, as is appropriate when dealing with things that matter to people, particularly those intermittently occurring, insincere events that are part and parcel of politics and governance during a time of war, bloodshed, and suffering. You'll probably have some understanding and sympathy for the parties who haven't wanted to get deeply involved. Their zeal to see justice done is moderated by the desire to see only the purely motivated act with only the most perfect rightness, and they haven't been able to see, in all of your choices, an unequivocal commitment to true freedom for all leading you to your destiny, sensing instead more complex motives. You'll probably understand and be willing to dismiss malice against the people who've been mislead by biased reporting in some of our media, specifically by pundits who hate particular things about your own media and act on that basis rather than on any understanding of deeper truths. Even though all this has happened -- people who should have come to your defense, Lady, with loud, supportive voices but instead remained silent -- people who, speaking to you for our nation, this England, should have chosen the warmer words that better convey caring and compassion you had a right to expect from us -- even though all this has happened, don't believe that there is a true divide between our countries, or that we have turned away from that valuing of freedom that, at one time, made us great.
