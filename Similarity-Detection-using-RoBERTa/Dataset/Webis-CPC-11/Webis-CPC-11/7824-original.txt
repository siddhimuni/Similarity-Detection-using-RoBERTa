It had to do with "Darby and Joan," and reminded me of J.L. MOLLOY'S
delightful song with that title. The rest of the music was not very striking. Even to those
who hold that the plot of an Opera is only of secondary importance, Sweet Nancy could not have
appeared to be exactly teeming with incidents. However, it was very nicely played by Miss HUGHES,
and that now mature Lancashire Lad, the aforesaid HENRY NEVILLE. Without declaring that I should
like to see it every evening for a thousand years (which I believe is a fa√ßon de parler even
in China), I certainly could sit it out again. If I wished to be a fault-finder I should say
that the piece is too long, and seems all the longer because some of the characters are supposed
to represent schoolboys, and a girl of thirteen. The adapter is Mr. BUCHANAN--a poet and a
playwright. This gentleman, I believe, has made many other pieces (more or less) his own, with
(more or less) success. He seems to have a knack of turning old plays into new ones. I live
in hope that when I next visit this great Metropolis I shall find that he has re-written the
School for Scandal, and brought Hamlet up to date.

Yours always, A CRITIC FROM THE COUNTRY.

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.

Monday to Saturday.--Nothing particular this week. Second July Meeting at Newmarket took a
lot of people away, and the thunder, hail and rain frightened a lot more away on Thursday,
so may as well discuss Esmeralda, which I hadn't time to do last week. Rather a mixed affair
to start with when you have a French libretto, set by an English Composer, and played at the
Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden. No matter. A big success for everyone concerned, from DRURIOLANUS
downwards. No one could have wished for a better Esmeralda than Madame MELBA, though she did
not make the most of that first charming song, "L'Hirondelle."
