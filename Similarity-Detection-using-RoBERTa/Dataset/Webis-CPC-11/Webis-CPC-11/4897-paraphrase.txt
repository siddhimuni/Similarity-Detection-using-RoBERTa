DEER OF NORTH-AMERICA, AND THE MODE OF HUNTING THEM.

(From Featherstonehaugh's Journal.) 

Deer is found to be rare in a country. Their population is low when compared to humans. They seek protection from humans. Because wild animals like wolves would kill them. One day we sat on a moonlight summer night,at the door of a log-cabin in our prairies and heard the wolves chase a deer. We also hear the crying sound of the deer. The crying sound gradually decreases as it runs for few miles. Likewise many deers are killed by hunters for their hides,skins,vension hams. These items are exported every year at 25 cents for one pair and it is sold again to 20 cents a pound. The most suitable time for hunters is when the pestures are green. At that time the deers would come to eat the greenish pestures.
