By means
of atmospheric electricity, and, indirectly, nature thus attains on a great scale the object
that we sometimes seek to accomplish in a limited space by fumigations with chlorine.

'Here, as in many other cases, we see nature effecting two different objects at one stroke.
For if the oxidizable miasma are destroyed by atmospheric ozone, they, in turn, cause the latter
to disappear, and we have seen that it is itself a miasm. This is doubtless the reason why
ozone does not accumulate in the atmosphere in greater proportion than the oxidizable miasma,
notwithstanding the constant formation of one and the other.

'In all times, the idea has been held, that storms purify the air, and I do not think that
this opinion is ill-founded. We know, in fact, that storms give rise to a more abundant production
of ozone. It is possible, and even probable, that sometimes, in particular localities, there
may not be a just relation between the ozone and the oxidizable miasma in the air, and that
the latter cannot be completely destroyed. Hence, in accordance with the chemical nature and
physiological influence of these miasma, they would exert a marked action on the animal economy,
and cause diseases among the greater number of those who breathe the infected air. But numerous
experiments prove that, as a rule, the air contains free ozone, though in very variable proportions;
from which we may conclude that no oxidizable miasm--sulphuretted hydrogen, for example--can
exist in such an atmosphere, any more than it could exist in air containing but a trace of
chlorine.

'I do not know if it be true, as has been advanced by Mr Hunt and other persons, that ozone
is deficient in the atmospheric air when some wide-spread malady, such as cholera, is raging.
