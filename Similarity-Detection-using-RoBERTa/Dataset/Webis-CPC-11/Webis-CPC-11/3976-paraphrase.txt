Of course everyone feels that, Woggles admitted. Only now that it is all over, aren't we sort of looking round and counting the cost? Thinking that all this loss of life and suffering hasn't made the world so very much better? Look at Russia and our strikes. Doesn't Bolshevism worry you?" she asked.
The fact is, I told her, I believe I've evolved a philosophy of life which nothing of that kind can seriously disturb--or I hope not. It's very jolly to feel like that.
It must be. May we have this philosophy, please? Perhaps you'll make a disciple.

It's an awfully simple one really, only I think people lose sight of it so strangely. Just to realise the extraordinary pleasure everyday things can give you--if you'll only let them. You compree that?

It doesn't sound very convincing, Woggles objected. "Everyday things! As for instance?

Oh, what shall I say? One of those really fine mornings; huge white clouds in a deep blue sky; the feel of a good drive at golf; smoke from cottage chimneys at dusk; wondering what's round the next corner of an unknown road; bare branches at night with the stars tangled in them; the wind that blows across these downs of ours; the music of a sentence of STEVENSON'S; Bogie here and his funny little ways--Well, I needn't go on?

No, you needn't, said Woggles thoughtfully and looked at me rather hard for a space. We're old friends, aren't we, and all that sort of thing? she demanded.

What a question! I hope we are. But why?
Well, I'm going to ask you something. But I may say I'm rather nervous. You'll promise not to set Bogie at me or strangle me with your Sam Browne?

I will.

Well, then, have you been asking Betty Willoughby to marry you, and has she said 'Yes'?

I was amazed. Was Woggles also among the soothsayers? Because a few evenings earlier, with the help of a splendid full moon and one or two extenuating circumstances--

But this is black magic and wizardry, I said. It's a dead secret.
