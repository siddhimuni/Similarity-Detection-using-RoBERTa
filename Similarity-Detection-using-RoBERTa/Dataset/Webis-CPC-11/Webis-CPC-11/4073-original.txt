If he was to have any name hereafter, his hope was on this, and
he did think he had in some instances succeeded;[238] that the sale of his poems increased
among the classes below the middle; and he had had, constantly, statements made to him of the
effect produced in reading 'Michael' and other such of his poems. I added my testimony of being
unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings. 'She was a phantom of delight'
he said was written on 'his dear wife,' of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner; a manner full
of the warmest love and admiration, yet with delicacy and reserve. He very much and repeatedly
regretted that my uncle had written so little verse; he thought him so eminently qualified,
by his very nice ear, his great skill in metre, and his wonderful power and happiness of expression.
He attributed, in part, his writing so little, to the extreme care and labour which he applied
in elaborating his metres. He said, that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre, the
time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable; that he was quite an epicure in sound. Latterly
he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings, and making them matter
for a theory or argument, that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and
injured his poetical powers. He said he had no idea how 'Christabelle' was to have been finished,
and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived, in his own mind, any definite plan for it;
that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse, and almost
in his presence, and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all
their literary projects and productions, and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing
it. Not that he doubted my uncle's sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary;
because, he said, schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind, and so
impressed him, that he often fancied he had arranged things, which really and upon trial proved
to be mere embryos.
