St. Athanasius tells pagans, who witnessed the sign of the cross is put to flight demons, oracles silence, and dissipate enchantments.

This power to terminate oracles, demons and the movement is also certified by Arnobius, Lactantius, Prudentius, Minutius, Felix, and many others. Their testimony is reliable evidence that the Messiah has not imposed a general silence on the oracles.

Emperor Julian called the Apostate, consulting the oracle of Apollo, in the suburbs of Antioch, the devil could make him no answer, other than that of St. Babylas body, buried in the neighborhood, imposed silence on him. King, transported with anger and rage, determined to avenge his gods, by eluding a solemn prediction of Christ. He ordered the Jews to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, but it starts to dig foundations, balls of fire burst out and consumed craftsman, tools and materials. These facts are attested by Ammianus Marcellinus, a pagan, and history of the emperor and by St. Chrysostom, St. Gregory Nazianzen, and Theodoret, and Socrates Sozomen in their ecclesiastical histories. The sophist Libanius, who was an enemy of Christians, testified also that holy oracle of Apollo Babylas was silence in the suburbs of Antioch.

Plutarch reports that Thamus pilot heard a voice in the air, shouting: - "Great Pan is dead" Eusebius then notes that the demons of death were common during the reign of Tiberius, when Christ cast out the evil spirits. Decisions can also be sent to oracles as possessions. It was special occasion, with divine permission, that Christians cast out devils, or oracles silenced in the presence and even the pagans themselves confession.
