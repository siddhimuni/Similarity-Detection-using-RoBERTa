Was there an eerie noise when he was writing it?  In a short while, there in the waters of Lerici Shelley was drowning and he did not know to swim.   This had a very cruel effect on us which was bothering us over time (this sense got strong and did not wade away by the lightness of verse and its lethal gratification) --  announcing its coming through the victim himself, the end upon which his hair is floating along the coasts of Campania.

He met with the end which he himself predicted, and Spezzia included another name from Marcelli who grieves much; Venetian glasses overflowed with foam and burst before the poison of life ascended to its top. 

Though Shelley was a singer by his temperament, this trait of his nature, made him as the poet of Prometheus Unbound.  With this he became the mythological poet in its very meaning of the utterance.  Mythological poetry gained their importance in trusting people and this child-like ingenious quality made him associate with people of his nature.  Shelley’s poetry also had the Nature Myths which were popularly accepted as the basis of all mythology.  The elements of Nature such as the gossiping lark which speaks of heaven, the winds that remove the grey from the beards of clouds, the clouds that had risen from the sea’s wide nostril, are incarnated and reincarnated in his metaphors and permeated into his descriptions. 

In this way, he can be considered very much as a Nature poet, but unlike the Worsdworthian implication of Nature, he looked at it from a different angle.  The exacting of the undeviating elucidation of Nature is welcomed by Wordsworthians; Nature should be considered dear to the poet like a mistress, and not as a servant.  But Shelley did not consider Nature in that connotation.
