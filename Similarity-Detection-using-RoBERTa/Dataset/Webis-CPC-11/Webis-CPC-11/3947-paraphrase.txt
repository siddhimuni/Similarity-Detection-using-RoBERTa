A rich soil furnishes too much nutriment, the plant grows very large and hervaceous, becomes overcharged power,especially if growing in a cold climate, and the equilibrium of the chemical propotions neccessary for the formation of natural juices becomes deranged at the expense of quantity and quality of the volatile oil produced.

These facts, long ago pointed out bu Linn√¶us, have been verified in England. Some years ago a disease manifested itself in most of the plantations,which, not being understood by the growers,was not remedied (in fact, is not generally understood and remedied at the present time), the acreage under cultivation decresed, and, partly owing to this and a scarcity occasioned by a failure in the crop, the price of the oil rapidly rose from 50s. to 200s. per lb. Consequently, with the continually increasing demand and the continued rise in price, manufactures of lavender water and of compound prefumes in which oil of lavender is a necessary ingredient commenced to buy the French oil, and venders of the English oil commenced to adulterate largely the English with the French oil.

By degress the French oil become almost entirely substituted in England for the English, and at present it is diggicult to purchase true English lavender water of a quality equal to that vended twenty years ago, expept at a few first class houses.

The exorbitant profits demanded by chemists and druggists, and the incomprehensible will of the public to byuy anything cheap, however bad, have encouraged a marvelous increase in the figures of the imports of French (and Germen,which is worse) oil.

In 1880, when the price had reached 125s. per lb., it was pointed out by an eminent London firm that unless the cultivation in Engliand were extended, the price would become prohibitive, inferior oils would be introduced into the market, and so destroy the popularity of this beautiful perfume.
