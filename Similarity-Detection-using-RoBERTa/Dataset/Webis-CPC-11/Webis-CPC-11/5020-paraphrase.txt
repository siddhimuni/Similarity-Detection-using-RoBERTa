"Brat!" cried Janet, and colored by purple, and when one makes as if he would be hit with a stick rags she had to chase them brutally, and next was begging and praying that he would have said one to none. It was "business naebody's whatever," she said, "would only start a conflict in the country, and there would be nothing for it but to drown the Dule water.

"Why?" Francie says.

The girl looked at him and rose again scarlet.

"And ISNA that, anyway," continued France. "It was just that he looked so good to you - as our Father in heaven, and I thought mebbe I thought that perhaps I was all wrong about him first. But I will be his Mr M'Brair say, are under some sort of deal to him to tell all. "
