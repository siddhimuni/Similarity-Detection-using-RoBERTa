There is a breezy carelessness about his methods which kills a story. My scalp bristled;" and you, if you are like me, suppress yawn  and say, "No, really?" There is a breezy carelessness  methods for killing a story. He clearly states, for instance, that the story  was told to him by a Mr. ROBERT DANE. In the first half of the narrative this gentleman's brother-in-law addresses him as Jack, and later on his wife says to him, "Oh, Edward." What a man whose  Christian name is so much a matter of opinion  what you express is meaningless

There seems to be an increasing interface of  public  At all events Mr. REGINALD LUCAS to his credit has already two or three successes in this kind. He has been encouraged to make a new production' The Measure of our Thoughts' (HUMPHREYS). It is difficult to be critical with a book like this;it can be said that the book either pleases the reader or not. One reason for my belief that Mr. LUCAS's thoughts will please is that he has put them into the brain of a definitely conceived and very well drawn character.

They are told in the form of letters by this character to his old tutor. The writer is unattractive and self-conscious eldest son of a noble house, suffering from  a father and sister who think him to be fool, and a brother who is charming. The special skill of the letters is their self-revelation, which shows the pathetic condition of the writer's position.  At the same time showing quite clearly the defects that explained it. Mr. LUCAS,does not commit the error of making his hero merely a mute, misunderstood paragon, whom anyone with common penetration must have recognised as such. To any casual acquaintance he  appeared only a dull and uninteresting egoist, on the contrary, we sympathise with him, especially in the big tragedy of his life. This I call clever, because it shows that Mr. LUCAS has created a real thinker, rather than striven to give him any unusual depth of thought. An agreeable book.

In the sixteenth chapter of the First Part of The Rocks of Valpré (FISHER UNWIN) Trevor Mordaunt married Christine Wyndham, and on the last page (which is the 511th) of the book, "she opened to him the doors of her soul, and drew him within...." Granted that Mordaunt, with the eyes of steel, was not exactly an oncoming man.  He received, as wedding presents, two or three brothers-in-law who depended hopelessly upon him.Miss ETHEL DELL has given us a detailed  account of the domestic differences between Mordaunt and his wife. I became frankly tired of the monetary crises of the Wyndhams and of their incurable inability to tell the truth.

I should have been relieved if Mordaunt got up and given these ineffective brethren a sound hiding. 
But preferred to make them writhe by using his steely eyes. In the future I suggest to Miss DELL that she should leave these strong silent men alone. They have had their day and gone out of vogue. The best part of this book is her treatment of the romantic friendship between Christine and Bertrand de Montville, and indeed the best work Miss DELL has yet done,  It is handled so touchingly and so surely that I resent with all the more ill tempered the triviality of the steel-eyed one.

We should like to be a Judge. It seems to be easy and well-paid work.  Can verdict judgements like "His lordship dismissed the application, with costs, and the jury found in his favour, assessing the damages at £1,000.
