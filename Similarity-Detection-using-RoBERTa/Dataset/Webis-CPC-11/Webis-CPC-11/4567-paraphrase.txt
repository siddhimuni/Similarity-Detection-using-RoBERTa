With the exception of The Grand Boulevard, there is no other American city that has kept its streets and avenues so clean. The Grand Boulevard which is 150 ft to 200 ft in width and 12 m in length is constructed around the city of Detroit except along the river front.  The Boulevard is free from congestion and the inhabitants have their own humble cottages with a garden in front.

The City Hall overlooks the Campus Martius.  Its three storeys, has a Renaissance style about it.  The first section of the tower, which has four corners, has four figures, representing justice, industry, art and commerce.  It also exhibits one of the world’s largest clock weighing 7670 lbs.  A 60 ft high ‘Soldiers’ and Sailors’ monument designed by Randolph Rogers also stands high.  Bronze eagles and figures representing the United States Infantry, Marine, Cavalry and Artillery rise from the four corners of the three sections.  Victory, Union, Emancipation and History are represented. 

The County Court House, facing Cadillac Square also looms high.  Another gigantic building, the Federal building has a finely decorated interior.

Not to be left behind are the churches of architectural beauty, the First congregational, St. John’s Episcopal, The Woodward Avenue Baptist and the First Presbyterian all on Woodward Avenue and St. Anne’s and Sacred Heart of Mary.

As with every other city The Grand Boulevard boasts of an interesting museum of Egyptian and Japanese collections.

The public library has one of the best collections of state and town histories in the country.
