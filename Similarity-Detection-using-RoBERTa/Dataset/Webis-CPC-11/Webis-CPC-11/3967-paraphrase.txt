Its publication in its amended form within 1773 had the influence of a bomb onto the literary social of Germany. It posted a shudder of horror across the sticklers for the rules of the classical drama which it overlooked with such contemptuous indifference; a shudder of delight across the strip of effervescing youths whom shared Goethe's revolutionary values, and towards whom Götz was a manifesto and a exam towards everybody old-fashioned conventions within literature and life. It was the immediate parent of that actually German growth--the literature of Sturm und Drang, whose exponents, says Kant, idea that they could not many effectively appear that they were budding geniuses than via flinging everybody rules towards the winds, and that one appears towards better advantage onto a spavined hack than onto a coached steed. The literature of Sturm und Drang was a ratifying phenomenon, but the influence of Götz did not end with its abortive life. But for Götz Schiller's morning productions would possess been differently inspired; and towards Götz also was due much of the inspiration of the following German Romantic School, although a lot of its advances were abhorrent towards Goethe's nature both within youth and maturity. It emancipated the drama from traditional shackles, but it did more: it extended the range of national idea, sentiment, and emotion, and for nice and evil introduced novel components into German literature which possess maintained their site there since its former portentous appearance. And German critics are unanimous within assigning another outcome towards the edition of Götz: within its style as within its form it predetermined convention at naught, and hence marks an epoch within the industry of German literary language. Not since Luther, "whose vocabulary were battles," had German been composed so organise from the heart and with such elemental drag as earns vocabulary living things.

It has been a commonplace word that 1773, the year of the edition of Götz, matches within European literature towards 1789 within European political history.
