Looking near the end of softening machine in Fig. 13,there is a receptacle. This receptacle is similar to the one used at the breaker card. 

Illustrated for you in Fig. 14 is a breaker card of modern design. The front of the card, also known as the delivery, is on the extreme left. the back of the card, or feed, is on the extreme right. In order to see the wheels, protective cages were removed. 

The figure shows a particular type of feed, termed "shell" feed. This is because the shape of the upper contour of the feed bracket resembles a shell. The figure also shows some stricks of fibre on the feed side. These are accommodated by the channel shaped stand on the far side of the slanted feed sheet. This sheet leads up to the grip of the feeding apparatus.

Pins of the feed roller and shell grip the stricks of fibre as they are fed in. They come in contact with the points of pins of the large roller, also known as the cylinder. This action is known as combing and splitting and takes place from the area where the sheet is fed in to the part of the machine about 24 to 30 inches below.
