Maitland was still asking questions as he arrived in Paddington.  His telegraph the evening prior had asked if the people that had previously been described had been seen.  When he found out before he left Tiverton that they hadn't, he figured they'd reached Westbourne Park where they'd handed in their tickets, at least if the ticket taker could be believed.

But no one there saw them get off.  There was no proof of them being there.  No one had seen the man in the fur coat or the man and young woman travelling together.

Maitland was confused and exhausted, as well as disgusted, when he got to town around nine.
