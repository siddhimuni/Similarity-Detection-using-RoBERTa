She stopped short as if an adder had stung her, uttering a harsh of rage, of pain; for Jasper Loosely, who had hitherto listen to her, stunned, astonished, here burst into a fit of merriment, in which there was such unconcealed contempt, such an enjoyment of the ridiculous, provoked by the idea of the marriage pressed upon him, that the insult pierced the woman to her very soul.
