On the morning of the 20th the admiral ordered the spare and stream anchors to be cut away,
and within the course of the day all the lower deck guns to be thrown overboard.--When evening
came, the spirits of the people in general, and even of the most courageous, began to fail,
and they openly expressed the utmost despair, together with the most earnest desire of quitting
the ship, lest they should founder in her.--The admiral hereupon advanced and told them, that
he and their officers had an equal regard for their own lives, and that the officers had no
intention of deserting either them or the ship, that, for his part, he was determined to try
one night more in her, he, therefore, hoped and intreated they would do so too, for there was
still room to imagine, that one fair day, with a moderate sea, might enable them, by united
exertions to clear and secure the well against the encroaching ballast which washed into it;
that if this could be done, they might be able to restore the chains to the pumps, and use
them; and that then hands enough might be spared to raise jury-masts, with which they might
carry the ship to Ireland; that her appearance alone, while she could swim, would be sufficient
to protect the remaining part of her convoy; above all, that as every thing that could be thought
of had now been done for her relief, it would be but reasonable to wait the effect. He concluded
with assuring them, that he would make the signal directly for the trade to lie by them during
the night, which he doubted not they would comply with.

This temperate speech had the desired effect; the firmness and confidence with which he spoke,
and their reliance on his seamanship and judgment, as well as his constant presence and attention
to every accident, had a wonderful effect upon them; they became pacified, and returned to
their duty and their labors. Since the first disaster, the admiral had, in fact, scarcely ever
quitted the deck; this they had all observed, together with his diligence in personally inspecting
every circumstance of distress. Knowing his skill and experience they placed great confidence
in them; and he instantly made, according to his promise, a signal for all the merchantmen.

At this period, it must be confessed, there was great reason for alarm, and but little for
hope; for all the anchors and guns, excepting one, together with every other matter of weight,
had been thrown overboard, and yet the ship did not seem at all relieved. The strength of the
people was, likewise, so nearly exhausted, having had no sleep since the first fatal stroke,
that one half of the crew were ordered to bail and the other to repose; so that, although the
wind was much abated, the water still gained upon them, in spite of all their efforts, and
the ship rolled and worked most prodigiously in a most unquiet sea.

At three in the morning of the 21st, being the fourth night, the well being quite broken in,
the casks, ballast and remaining shot, rushed together and destroyed the cylinders of the pumps;
the frame and carcase of the ship began to give way in every part, and the whole crew exclaimed
that it was impossible to keep her any longer above water.

In this extremity the admiral resolved within himself not to lose a moment in removing the
people whenever day-light should arrive, but told the captain not to communicate any more of
his design than that he intended to remove the sick and lame at day-break; and for this purpose
he should call on board all the boats of the merchantmen.
