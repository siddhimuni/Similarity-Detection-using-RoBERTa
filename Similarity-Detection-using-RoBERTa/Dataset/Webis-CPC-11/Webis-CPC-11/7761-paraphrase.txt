There are those among us who would take for granted the grace that God extends to them who make irrational claims regarding personal spiritual experiences.  I cannot count the number of times I have heard someone profess to have "beheld God in all His Glory".  Men who try to convince me of such things may as well try to persuade me of wingless men flying through the air.  It is, unfortunately, all too common that men give up soundness and reason for want of relief and escape from the mundane and the harshness of everyday realities.  We should not seek to entertain ourselves with such fanciful notions, since it does nothing but take us away from the practical, important matters with which we must, and ought, to concern ourselves with. Furthermore, he that questions the validity of such "religious experiences" should not feel as though he has committed an offense towards God or his fellow man, especially when the seeming unexplainable can in fact be explained in scientific and logical terms.  St. Augustine himself has stated, in so many words, that a wise man will proceed with caution when he does not know all the facts.

Many years ago, I took a trip to meet with a powerful man, a prince, who granted me the opportunity to observe for myself a group of prisoners, that my curiosity might be satisfied.  With the prince in attendance, I saw about ten or twelve of them, including a deformed, hideous looking old woman who had once been very well-versed in witchcraft.
