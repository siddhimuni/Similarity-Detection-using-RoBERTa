A republican British journalist of our have day, in lead to demonstrate the law of compensation, as regards the literary line of task, cites its inexpensiveness,--arguing, that, though the artist must invest finance, however small, in colors, marble, canvas, and studio-hire, and the representative man occupy a very expensive environs, the journalist requires but a quire of foolscap and a pen and ink to initiate in trade. While there is literal certainty in this comparison, the sighting is not pertinent to historical writing, if not in a very limited degree. The preparation of the bulk successful works in this department, in modern times, has been attended with an outlay despairing to the broke scholar. It has fascinated the check and reproduction of voluminous manuscript administrators, distant journey, the pay for of rare stories and family papers, and sometimes years of busy reference, observation, and examine, lucrative simply in prospect. The same measure of way of life and facile vigor of composition which smaller diagram prosperous authors expend on a masterly check would suffice to generate them renowned historians, if blessed with the pecuniary method to explore foreign lineages of learning, or put combined come seal them scattered and rare materials wherewith to weave a chronicle of the past. Hence, not simply has History become the picked field of writers with no special gift for more alone stimulated types of literature, but of the lectured sons of fortune. Accordingly, it is curious to remark the evaluate between the survives of historians and those of poets; and in the average circumstances of the earlier there is numerous justification for the label of an aristocratic guild in letters. Compare Cowper's humble home at Olney with Gibbon's elegant library at Lausanne,--the social setting of Hallam, Grote, or Macaulay with the rustic isolation of Wordsworth, the economies of Shelley, or the life-struggle of Jerrold.
