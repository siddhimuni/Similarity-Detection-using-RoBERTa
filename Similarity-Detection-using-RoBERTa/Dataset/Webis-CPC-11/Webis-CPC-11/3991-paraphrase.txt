It had the signature of the elder Barricini. It informed Orso that he was laying the threatening letter sent to his son before the public prosecutor. His missive concluded: "I have a clear conscience, so I will wait patiently until the law has decided about your calumnies."

At the same time five or six herdsmen arrived to garrison the della Rebbia Tower. They had been summoned by Colomba. Even though Orso protested, archere were arrenged in the windows looking onto the square. Through all the evening there came offers of service from persons belonging to the village. There was even a letter from the bandit-theologian saying that in the event of the mayor's calling on the gendarmes, he and Brandolaccio would intervene. The letter was closed by the following postscript:

"May I ask you what the Signor Prefetto thinks of the excellent education bestowed by my friend on brusco, the dog? Together with Chilina, he is the most docile and promising pupil I have ever come across."


CHAPTER XVI

Next day was not followed by any hostile demonstration. Both sides did not attack. Orso stayed in the house, and the door of the Barricini dwelling remained closely shut. The five gendarmes walked about the square and the outskirts of the village, together with the village constable, the sole representative of the urban police force. The deputy-mayor never put off his sash. There was no sign of war, except the loopholes in the two opponents' houses. Only a Corsican would have noticed that the group round the evergreen oak in the middle of the square consisted of only women.


At supper-time Colomba showed her brother a letter. The letter was from Miss Nevil.


"My dear Signorina Colomba," it ran, "I learn with pleause, through a letter from your brother, that your enmities are all at an end. I congratulate you heartily.
