From the start of the work, where the boy wakes up on the hill to see a beautiful woman and a huge beast, this is quite a journey.

The only issue I have is that both the hero and his love interest treated the secondary male character horribly.  This is frustrating, as he had also expressed love for the heroine, and in her blind love for the hero, she goes along with his mistreatment of their companion.  This is typical, but I still disapprove.  Beyond this one complaint, Wolf-lure is an excellent new novel.

Calvary Alley (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is a bit confusing, as though it opens with an Old World feeling of choir-boys and stained glass, the book later introduces more modern objects and roles, such as the police and modern currency.  This seems to be a common thing in stories written by Alice Rice, so I should not have been surprised.

The story is an entertaining depiction of Nance, the heroine, and her upward journey from filthy slums all the way up to marriage.  The story was gripping, and the development of Nance from a street urchin to a grown woman was believable and engaging.  Unfortunately the author's depiction of the church in America is woefully inaccurate, leaving me to believe that she may have experienced different in England.  Despite the inherent flaws, it was still an enjoyable read.

*****

The book Christine is an illuminating look at pre-war Germany that is only hindered by poor presentation.  The novel is advertised as new, however there is a Publisher's note that suggests otherwise.  While it is portrayed as fiction, the truth appears to be that this book is based more in fact, only altered to protect those involved.

This lends the book a sense of realism that is difficult to otherwise obtain without having been there, and though I now believe Cholmondeley used the book as a way to tell her tale, rather than an original work of fiction, it is a tale worth reading.  It gives a deep and full view of life in Germany before the war.  Just take the foreword with a grain of salt.

The Four Corners of the World (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is a great little collection of stories for casual reading, perfect for a rainy day or a slow evening.  Mr. Mason writes in such a way to let the stories stand on their own, without the need for the author to tell you how exciting the story is as you read it.  You are left to experience the tales on your own, a very satisfying experience.
