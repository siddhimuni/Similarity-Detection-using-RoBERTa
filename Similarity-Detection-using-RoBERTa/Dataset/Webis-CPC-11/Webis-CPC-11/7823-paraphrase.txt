It was concerning "Darby and Joan" and reminiscent of the wonderful J.L. MOLLOY ditty of the same name. Musically, none of it was especially memorable beyond that. No matter how you look at it, Sweet Nancy was not exactly overflowing with significant plotting; even those who consider an opera's storyline secondary to its musicality would probably bemoan the sheer lack of events. Performances, however, were top-notch, featuring great turns from Miss HUGHES and, as we mentioned, that former Lancashire Lad HENRY NEVILLE -- now all grown up. It might not be my first choice if I had to watch the same show night after night for the next thousand years -- which, even in China (I think) is a fa√ßon de parler -- but I'd see it again, nonetheless. If I was a nit-picky mood, I could criticize the overlong performance time, a characteristic that is prolonged even further by the fact that certain are meant to be young male students, and a girl who's just turned thirteen. The adaptation was handled by poet and playwright, Mr. BUCHANAN who has made his mark (relatively speaking) on numerous past projects with, more of than not, a successful outcome. He has a gift for transforming established work into newly-invigorated creations. My hope is that, upon my return to this vibrant city, I'll discover he's reinterpreted School for Scandal and revived Hamlet with a modern spin.

Most sincerely, A CRITIC FROM THE COUNTRY

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY. 

Monday-Saturday. Nothing especially notable during this time. The July Newmarket meeting (number two, for those who're counting) prevented a lot of people from attending, and Thursday's showers, thunderstorms and intermittent hail had a similar effect. So let's focus for a moment on Esmeralda, which I was unable to do a week ago due to time constraints. The diverse collection of elements -- a performance of a French libretto set by an English composer and staged at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden -- might seem to make for a disjointed result. Not to fear, however. It was a winner for all involved, from DRURIOLANUS on down. One would be hard-pressed to find a more pleasing Esmeralda than that offered by Madame MELBA (even though her take on the first musical offering -- "L'Hirondelle" -- was less than spectacular).
