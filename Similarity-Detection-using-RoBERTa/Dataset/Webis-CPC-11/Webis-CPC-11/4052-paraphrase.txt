I see you there, oh moon of dust, with Spring' reviver's eye. I have to risk my perfect want to sing a lullaby.

The field is getting older now, and trees are turning green. And I can see it in my child, as no one yet had seen.

It was just yesterday, when birds were shouting me to wake up, but now they all are shy for me while putting on my make up.

It always happens in the Spring, which hardly can resist it, and hardly ever I can say, regretfully, "I missed it!" 

And the wind blows of my hat, with miserable laughter, I have been here, I am am here, and I will be after.

Who am I to see all that, all that gorgeous nature - it's impossible for me and for you to capture.

That's to hard for me to see that I have no measure, for how many - two or three - hats I gave with pleasure.
