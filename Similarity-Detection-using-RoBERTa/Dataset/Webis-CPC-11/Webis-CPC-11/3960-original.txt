It is the peculiar province,
for instance, of a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these
are contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, sufficient to
invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage
taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would
not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were concerned on either side, it would be impossible
for the federal judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction.
Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different States, may afford another
example of the necessity of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning
may not be so palpable in those States where the formal and technical distinction between LAW
and EQUITY is not maintained, as in this State, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.

The judiciary authority of the Union is to extend:

Second. To treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
and to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. These belong to
the fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with the preservation
of the national peace.

Third. To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. These form, altogether, the fifth of
the enumerated classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts.

Fourth. To controversies to which the United States shall be a party. These constitute the
third of those classes.

Fifth. To controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another
State; between citizens of different States. These belong to the fourth of those classes, and
partake, in some measure, of the nature of the last.

Sixth. To cases between the citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different
States.
