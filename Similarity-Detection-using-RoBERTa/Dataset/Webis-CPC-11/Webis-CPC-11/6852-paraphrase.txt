Atmospheric electricity and indirectly nature By means n a great scale the object that we sometimes seek to accomplish in a limited space by fumigations with chlorine.
'Here, as in many  cases we see nature effecting two different objects at one stroke. For if the oxidizable miasma are destroyed by atmospheric ozone. they,  cause the latter to disappear, and we have seen that it is a miasm.This is doubtless the reason why ozone does not accumulate in the atmosphere in greater proportion than the oxidizable miasma, not with standing the constant formation of one and the other.
 In all times, the idea has been held, that storms purify the air, and  this opinion is ill-founded. We know, in fact, that storms give rise to a more abundant production of ozone. It is possible that sometimes, in particular localities, there may not be a just relation between the ozone and the oxidizable miasma in the air, and that the latter cannot be completely destroyed. Hence, accordance with the chemical nature and physiological influence of these miasma, they would exert a marked action on the animal economy, and cause diseases among   breathe the infected air.
 But numerous experiments prove that, as a rule, the air contains free ozone, though in very variable proportions; from which may be concluded that no oxidizable miasm--sulphuretted hydrogen, for example--can exist in such an atmosphere,  than it could exist in air containing but a trace of chlorine.
  'I don't know if it be true, as   advanced by Mr Hunt and other persons, that ozone is deficient in the atmospheric air when some wide-spread malady, such as cholera, is raging
