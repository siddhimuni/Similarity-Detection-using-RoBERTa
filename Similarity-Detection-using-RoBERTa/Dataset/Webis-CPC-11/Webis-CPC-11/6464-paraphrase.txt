Even though he was incredibly consumed with hypothetical challenges of the method of scientific teaching, his friend Reverend W. Rogers of Bishopsgate still asked him to teach a lesson on the fundamentals of science to some of the school's students.

After much delay and thought, he agreed to help his friend and then proceeded to give 12 different lessons, one each week, throughout the months of April, May and June. He spoke at the London Institution in Finsburgy Circus to a crowd that included all ages.

He wrote his friend this letter:

February, 1869

My friend,

I am ready and willing to begin the scientific lectures we have discussed previously. It is a very difficult time of the year for me so I know the teaching will be a challenge; I hope there won't be too many obstacles along the way.
