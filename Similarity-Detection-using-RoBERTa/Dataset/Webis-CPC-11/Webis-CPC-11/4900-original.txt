The largest and best known system on the visible surface.

Zuchius. A remarkable ray-system, but one which is only well seen when libration is favourable.

Bailly. N. of the centre of this great enclosure are two very distinct radiating streaks.

Schickard. Four conspicuous light spots, probably craters, on the S.E.

Byrgius A. A brilliant ray-centre, most of the rays trending eastward from a nimbus.

Hainzel. There are several bright spots E. of this formation.

Mersenius. Two or three light-rays originate from a point on the W. rampart.

Mersenius C. A light-surrounded crater with short rays.

Grimaldi. There are three bright spots on the W. wall.

Damoiseau. A light-surrounded crater W. of Damoiseau, E. long. 58 deg., S. lat. 6 deg.

Flamsteed C. A light-surrounded crater on a dark surface.

Birt a. A light-surrounded crater.

Landsberg. E. of Landsberg, four light-surrounded craters, forming with Landsberg A (in the
Second Quadrant) an interesting group.

Lohrmann A. A light-surrounded crater, with a light area a few miles N. of it. S. lat. 1 deg.,
E. long. 61 deg.

Euclides. Has a conspicuous nimbus with traces of rays, a typical example.

Guerike. There is a crater, with nimbus, W. of this, in E. long. 12 deg., S. lat. 11 deg. 5 min.

Parry. A very brilliant light-spot in the S. wall.

Parry A. Surrounded by a bright nimbus.

Alpetragius B. A conspicuous light-surrounded crater, one of the most remarkable on the moon.

Alpetragius d (E. long. 11 deg., S. lat. 13 deg. 8 min.). A bright spot, seen by Madler as
a crater, but which, as Schmidt found in 1868, no longer answers to this description.

Mosting C. A light-surrounded crater.

Lalande. Has a large nimbus and distinct rays.

Hell. A large ill-defined spot in E. long. 4 deg., S. lat. 33 deg. This is most probably the
site of the white cloud seen by Cassini.

Mercator. There is a brilliant crater and light area under E. wall.

FOURTH QUADRANT.

Stevinus a. A crater E. of Stevinus; it is a centre of wide extending rays.

Furnerius A. Prominently light-surrounded, with bright streaks, radiating for a long distance
N. and S.

Messier A. The well-known "Comet" rays, extending E. of this.

Langrenus. Has a large but very pale ray-system. It is best seen under a low evening sun. Three
long streaks radiate towards the E. from the foot of the glacis of the S.E. wall.

Censorinus. A very brilliant crater with faint rays.

Theophilus. The central mountain is faintly light-surrounded.

Madler. This ring-plain and the neighbourhood on the N. and N.W., include many bright areas
and curious streaks.

Almanon. About midway between this and Argelander is a very brilliant little crater.

Beaumont. Between this and Cyrillus stand three considerable craters with nimbi.

Cyrillus A. A prominent light-surrounded crater.

Alfraganus. A light-surrounded crater with rays.
