THE ASSAY FOR CYANIDE BY TITRATION WITH SILVER NITRATE.

The determination of the quantity of a cyanide is made by finding how much silver nitrate is
required to convert the whole of the cyanide into potassium silver cyanide[39] or one of the
allied compounds. It will be seen from the equation that 170 parts by weight of silver nitrate
are required for 130 parts by weight of potassium cyanide. As already explained it is customary
to report the cyanide-strength in terms of potassium cyanide, even when only the sodium salt
is present. One gram of potassium cyanide will require 1.3076 gram of silver nitrate. The standard
solution of silver nitrate is made by dissolving 13.076 grams of silver nitrate in distilled
water and diluting to 1 litre; 100 c.c. of such a solution are equivalent to 1 gram of potassium
cyanide.[40]

The titration is performed in the usual way, running the standard solution of silver nitrate
into a solution containing a known weight or volume of the material containing the cyanide.
The finishing point is determined in one of two ways, both of which are largely used. In the
first place, as long as there remains any free cyanide in the solution the silver nitrate will
combine with it forming the double cyanide and yielding a clear solution; but as soon as all
the free cyanide is used up the silver nitrate will react with the double cyanide[41] forming
silver cyanide, which separates as a white precipitate and renders the solution turbid. But,
in the second place, if potassium iodide is present in the solution the excess of silver nitrate
will react with it,[42] rather than with the double cyanide; and silver iodide will separate
as a yellowish turbidity which is easily recognised.
