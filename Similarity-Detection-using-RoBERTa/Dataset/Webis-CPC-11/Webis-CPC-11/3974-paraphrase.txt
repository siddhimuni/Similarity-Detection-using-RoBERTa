The student broke the rules of the flying school by flying further than the allowed distance of the aerodome on his maiden flight itself. Beyond the aerodrome he encountered a main road consisting of tramway lines. At that very moment a tram was passing. The tram had a few passengers on the roof who were amazed as well  as frightened to see a plane fly so low on over the fields and then pass just above their heads. Then after flying all around the country side he decided to head back to the autodrome hesistantly. The autodrome was surrounded with some trees forming a kind of border to it. The pilot started flying into the direction of these trees as if he was going to go right through them. but as he came closer to them he tilted his plane sideways and passed through the gap in between these trees just like an professional pilot and then landed on the aerodrome strip. After he got off the plane he "not having turned a hair" as the legend goes he started walking and removing his kit off. Just to let you know that there is no record of what happened to the pilot after this incident just as their is no record of this story either.
