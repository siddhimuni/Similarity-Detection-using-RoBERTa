The 'everlasting Negro' is unintelligent and unaspiring, yet he too practices in one of the grandest traditions known to man, gambling. 

The Negro uses shells as dice as the Romans and Britons used lotteries. Riches from estates to livestock were all incentives to buy into these ancient lotteries. The noblest of man participated in these lotteries! Take King Theodoric whose makeshift dice accompanied him on his valiant expeditions. Those wishing to win the grace of Theodoric would often play him in a game of dice.
