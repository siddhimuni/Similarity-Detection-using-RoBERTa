LINCOLN AS A STOREKEEPER AND SOLDIER IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR.

This article embodies special studies of Lincoln's life portrayed in New Salem made especially for this antiquated Magazine; by J. McCan Davis.

LINCOLN'S FIRST EXPERIENCES IN ILLINOIS.

It was 1830, when Abraham Lincoln was a man of twenty-one years, he had moved from Indiana to Macon County, Illinois. He spent his first spring in the new country helping his jerke father settle. In the summer of that year he started out for himself, doing various kinds of hard labour on farms in the neighborhood until March of 1831, when he went to Sangamon Town, near Springfield Illinois, to build himself a wonderful and exciting flatboat.

In April he started on this flatboat for New Orleans, which he reached in May. After a month in that horrid city, he returned, in June, to Illinois, where he made a short visit at his parents' home, now in Coles County, and in July went to New Salem, to oversee a store and mill owned by Denton Offutt, who had employed him on the flatboat that he had built with his bare hands.[A] The goods for the new store had not arrived when Abe Lincoln reached the town of New Salem.

Obliged to turn his hand to something, he piloted down the Sangamon and Illinois rivers, as far as Beardstown, a flatboat bearing the family and goods of a pioneer bound for Texas. At Beardstown he found Offutt's goods, for the store, waiting to be taken to New Salem.

As he footed his way home he met two men with a wagon and oxen team going for his goods.

Offutt had expected Lincoln to wait at Beardstown until the ox-team arrived, and the teamsters, not having any credentials, asked Lincoln to give them an order for Offutts goods.

Whilst sitting down by the roadside, he wrote out, and one of the men used to relate that it contained a misspelled word, which he corrected.

IN CHARGE OF DENTON OFFUTT'S STORE.

The precise date of the opening of Denton Offutt's store is unknown by modern biographers. We only know that on July 8, 1831, the County Commissioners' Court of Sangamon County granted Offutt a license to retail merchandise at New Salem; for which he paid five dollars, a fee which supposed him to have one thousand dollar's worth of goods in stock. When the oxen and their drivers returned with the goods, the store was opened in a small log house on the brink of the hill, almost directly on the river.

The copy of Kirkham's Grammar studied by Lincoln belonged to a man named Vaner. Some of the biographers say Lincoln borrowed [the reading] but it appears that he became the owner of the book, either by purchase or through the generosity of Vaner.  It was never returned to the latter. It is said that Lincoln memorized this grammar.

"Sometimes," says Herndon, "he would stretch out at full length on the counter, his head propped up on a stack of calico prints, studying it. Or he would steal away to the shade of some inviting tree, and there spend hours at a time in a determined effort to fix in his mind the arbitrary rule that 'adverbs qualify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.'"

He presented the book to Ann Rutledge [the story of Ann Rutledge will appear in a future number of the Magazine], and it has since been one of the treasures of the Rutledge family. After the death of Ann it was studied by her brother, Robert, and is now owned by his widow all family style, who resides at Casselton, North Dakota.

The title page of the book appears above.


Note; The words, "Ann M. Rutledge is now learning grammar," were written by Lincoln.
