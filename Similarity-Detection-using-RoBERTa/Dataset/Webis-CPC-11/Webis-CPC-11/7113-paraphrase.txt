For us it was cold all day on the ridges exposed to a biting and chilli wind, so we had ourselves bundled into sweaters , coats over flannel shirts. Later we went down about 1,000 feet and tied all our coats to saddle pockets, on the second thousand we took off our sweaters and for the rest of the descent had our sleeves rolled up and our shirts oopen at the throat. We came from the middle of the winter into the hot summer in matter of two hours and that was huge change.It was as if we had rode into an a fake heated building like the rooms tropical plants at a botanical gardens.

On a flat plain was our camp just over the river where there was a great view of the wide valley which was like the bottom of a wellwith very large mountains rising everywhere.

It was a place with stange contrast. The trees and the bushes were in full green color and the lawn and paddy fiels had been dry and brownish as in mid winter. Some thick trees located on the base of the hills were literally alive. That night was the first time we had heard a muntjac barkt too.

The soldier who took us from Shih-tien delivered his official dispatch at a village further down through the valley.

A proved Shan native magistrate arrive a little after with ten or twelve men and we learned that there was only one man in the whole village that spoke Chinese.

The magistrate at Ma-po-lo by had our safety in charge and kept reminding us that there were no game or hunting in his village.

He wanted to get rid of us and was probaly telling the truth that the valley was so cultivated.

Morning time the valley was filled with dense white fog but we left it immediatly by climbing and by noon were back in winter on the summit of the ridges.
