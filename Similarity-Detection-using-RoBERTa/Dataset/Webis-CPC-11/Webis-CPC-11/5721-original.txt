Nae sooner, then, had he got the note, than he opened it out, and lookit at it wi' his wee
glowrin', restless een, as if to see that it wasna a forgery. He then shook his head like a
doctor, when he's no very sure what's wrang wi' a person, but wants to mak' it appear that
he kens a' about it--and continued in this style till the Heelandman's patience began to get
exhausted.

"Can ye no change the note, old shentleman?" quo' Donald. Nosey gi'ed his head anither shake,
and looked uncommon wise.

"Is the note no goot, sir?"' spak the Heelandman, a second time; but the cratur, instead of
answering him, only gi'ed anither of his wise shakes, as much as to say, "I'm no very sure
about it." At this Donald lost temper. "If the note doesna please ye, sir," quo' he, "I'll
thank ye to gie me it back again, and I'll gang to some ither place." And he stretchit out
his hand to tak hand o't, when my frien' wi' the tail, lifting up his stick, lent him sic a
whack ower the fingers as made him pu' back in the twinkling of an ee.

"Got tamn ye, ye auld scounrel," said the man; "do ye mean to tak my money frae me?" And he
lifted up a rung big eneuch to fell a stot, and let flee at the monkey; but Nosey was ower
quick for him, and jumping aside, he lichted on a shelf before ane could say Jock Robinson.
Here he rowed up the note like a baw in his hand, and put it into his coat pouch like any rational
cratur. Not only this, but he mockit the Heelandman by a' manner of means, shooting out his
tongue at him, spitting at him, and girning at him wi' his queer outlandish physiognomy. Then
he would tak haud of his tail in his twa hands, and wag it at Donald, and steeking his nieves,
he would seem to threaten him wi' a leatherin'. A'thegither he was desperate impudent, and
eneuch to try the patience of a saunt, no to spak o' a het-bluided Heelandman. It was gude
for sair een to see how Donald behavit on this occasion. He raged like ane demented, misca'ing
the monkey beyond measure, and swearing as mony Gaelic aiths as micht hae sair'd an ordinar
man for a twalmonth. During this time, I never sterr'd a foot, but keepit keeking frae the
back shop upon a' that was ganging on. I was highly delighted; and jealousing that Nosey was
ower supple to be easily catched, I had nae apprehension for the event, and remained snug in
my birth to see the upshot.

In a short time, in comes Mr. Weft wi' a piece of lowing paper in his hand that he had got
frae the next door to licht the shop; and nae sooner did Donald see him than he ax'd him for
his note.

"What note, honest man?" said Mr. Weft.

"Got tamn," quo' Donald; "the note the auld scounrel, your grandfather, stole frae me."

"My grandfaither!" answered the ither wi' amazement. "I am thinking, honest man, ye hae had
a glass ower muckle. My grandfaither has been dead for saxteen years, and I ne'er heard tell
till now that he was a fief."

"Weel, weel, then," quo' the Heelandman, "I don't care naething about it. If he's no your grandfaither,
he'll be your faither, or your brither, or your cousin."

"My faither or my brither, or my cousin!" repeated Mr. Weft. "I maun tell ye plainly, frien',
that I hae neither faither, nor brither, nor cousin of ony description on this side of the
grave. I dinna understand ye, honest man, but I reckon that ye hae sat ower lang at the whisky,
and my advice to ye is to stap awa hame and sleep it aff."

At this speech the Heelandman lost a' patience, and lookit sae awfully fairce, that ance or
twice I was on the nick of coming forrit, and explaining how matters really stood; but curiosity
keepit me chained to the back shop, and I just thocht I would bide a wee, and see how the affair
was like to end.

"Pray, wha are you, sir?" said Donald, putting his hands in his sides, and looking through
his specks upon Mr. Weft, like a deevil incarnit. "Wha are you, sir, that daar to speak to
me in this manner?"

"Wha am I?" said the ither, drapping the remnant of the paper, which was burnin' close to his
fingers.
