Not a star can twinkle in the abyss of night, but science will
tell its rate of light, and describe its silent and mysterious orbit. Torrid heat, the earthquake,
the tornado, the pestilence, mountains of ice, craters of flame--science will dare them all,
to know one more law of nature. God speed the daring of science, if only her votaries will
not place the law in the place of Him who made both it and the works which it was commissioned
to guide. Science, when she has found the highest and the most comprehensive law of nature,
has not touched Deity itself; she has but touched the hem of the garment of the Great Lawgiver.

One veteran of science, Alexander von Humboldt, has yielded to the great law of humanity, as
inexorable as any that he found in nature.
