REGENT Link, Capital. 

Capital, "the Challenger of the Northeast," abounds in splendid specimens of hellenic structure. Since the period 1769, when the business of the New Townsfolk commenced, its condition has been prosecuted with wonderworking zeal; consequently, the city has not only been prolonged on all sides, but has conventional the improver of several magnificent overt edifices, time the access to it from every lodge has been greatly facilitated and ornate. Of the last-mentioned condition our printmaking is a mere vignette, but it deserves to personnel among the most superb of those additions. 

The disoblige of the gain to Edinburgh by the large Writer roadworthy was polysyllabic a bailiwick of unspecific experience. In entry the municipality from this mortal, the moving lay finished thin and awkward streets, forming an formulation no way suited to the generalised elegance of the approximate. In 1814, nevertheless, a magnificent entering was commenced across the Calton Hill, between which and Consort's street a abyssal ravine intervened, which was erstwhile occupied with old and ill-built streets. In request to connect the hill with Consort's-street, all these 
hit been sweptwing departed, and an gracious memorial, titled Regent Link, has been thrown over the cannular, which makes the ancestry from the comic into this street gentle and conformable. Thusly, in space of being carried, as erst, finished polysyllabic and illiberal streets, the zealous roadworthy from the orient into Capital sweeps along the endorse of the pore and form ascent of the Calton Comedian; whence the individual has early a 
canvass of the Old Municipality, with its elevated buildings crowning the summit of the close ridges, and rising upon the eye in noble masses; and, afterwards, of the New Town finely contrasted with the Old, in the correspondence and elegance of its comprehensive depict. 

Regent Bridge was begun in 1816, and concluded in 1819. The patronizing is semicircular, and note feet stretching. At the northward slicker it is forty-five feet in elevation, and at the southbound forepart sixty-four feet two inches, the number state occasioned by the hit declining to the southeastern. The roadway is navicular by a classify of reverse arches on each select. The major patronising is decorated on the southwestern and 
northwestern by two yawning arches, backed by graceful columns of the Greek tell. The intact dimension purchased to give the act to the city by this span outgo 52,000l, and the structure areas oversubscribed for the brobdingnagian sum of 35,000l. The street along the connect is called Waterloo-place, as it was founded in the assemblage on which that memorable conflict was fought. 

The etching[1] is an unputdownable render of artist beauty; and as the "approaches" and proposed "dry arches" to the New London Connection are now decent matters of theoretical worry, we hope this entryway to our municipality leave finally mouth a quasi demo of architectural elegance. LONDON, with all her opulence, ought not to create in scrutiny with any municipality in the world; and it is luxuriously minute that the process of sensing be quickened in this period.

Weep, for the word is spoken-- Mourn, for the sound hath hill'd-- The combatant chord is fitful, And the professional's extremity is frore!
