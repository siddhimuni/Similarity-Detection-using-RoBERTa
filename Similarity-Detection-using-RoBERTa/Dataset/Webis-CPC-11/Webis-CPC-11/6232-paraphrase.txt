Baby dragging a bunt is a beautiful quarto with one of the most attractive outsides we have witnessed for a long time. It is realised up of select stories adapted to the reading of children from four to eight years of age. They are all short, few of them being dismissed a page in length, and to each one is companied by a full page engraving. It is just the thoughtful of book that had better to be democratic, and doubtless will be.

wet behind the ears FOLKS' HISTORY OF GERMANY. By Charlotte M. Yonge. Boston: D. Lothrop & Co. Price, $1.50.

This well-favoured volume is the first of a series, which will admit the principal countries of Europe, the delivering the goods enumerates of which will get along at brief intervals. Miss Yonge, whose talents have been exerted in various directions for the gain of young readers, has been peculiarly successful in this series, which has had a very large sale in Europe, and deserves a like popularity here. It covers not only the total period of German civilization down to the present time, but it gives an account of ancient Germany and its inhabitants in times which might almost be called in pre-historic. The first chapters are explanatory of the German mythology, and of the ancient methods of worship. The Nibelungen dwelt is accounted and its story severalized. The real history gets down about the year 496 A.D...., at a time when the Franks were the victorious cannonball along in Europe. From that time down to the beginning of the present year the record is continuous. The volume is extravagantly instanced.

HAPPY MOODS OF HAPPY CHILDREN. Original Poems. By favorite American authors. Boston: D. Lothrop & Co. Price $1.00.

We stake to say that no publishing provide in the country will issue this season anything choicer in the way of a presentation book of poems than this charming volume. The poems it dampens were redacted expressly for Mr. Lothrop, and have never onward been brought collectively in collected mold. Among the authors represented are Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Clara Doty Bates, Margaret G. Preston, Ella Farman, Mrs. Platt, Harriet McEwen Kimball, Mary A. Lathbury, Nora Perry, Mrs. L. C. Whiton, Celia Thaxter, Edgar Fawcett, and many others. Although the volume is ostensibly favorite for children, it is one which grown-up people will equally enjoy. There are a tally or more of illustrations, most of them full-page, hunky-dory drawn and inscribed.
