Furthermore I would like to go back magnificently made many trips over the interior plains, mountains, deserts and before the days of the completed Pacific Railroad, with regular "Doughertys" drawn by four smart mules, one soldier with carbine or loaded musket in hand seated beside the driver, back seat with two loaded rifles swung in the loops made for them as luggage easier, and generally a sack of oats to supplement the grass, and attach the mules to their camp. In a suit by two, three or four such trips I made as much as eighteen hundred miles in a single season, usually from post to post, on average about two hundred miles away for a week with as much regularity as a steam car is today its five hundred miles a day, but those days are gone, and while recognizing the advantages of national transportation faster, I can not help occasionally regretting the change. One example in 1866 rose to my memory, which should record: Returning to the east of Fort Garland, we ascended the Rocky Mountains to the Sangre Cristo Pass. Descending mountain road was very rough and sidling. I went with my gun, and walked about four miles ahead of where I expected my "Dougherty." After an hour or so I saw coming down the road, a wagon, and does not recognize as my own until quite close. She was upset, top mashed all and any means at hand for repairs. We, therefore, deviated from the main road to a camp of cavalry near the Spanish Peaks, where we were hospitably received by the main A ---- and his wife made. They occupied a large hospital-tent, which about a dozen beautiful greyhounds were free to enter freely. Ambulance was repaired, and the next morning we renewed our journey, escorted by his wife on important and their fine saddle horses.
