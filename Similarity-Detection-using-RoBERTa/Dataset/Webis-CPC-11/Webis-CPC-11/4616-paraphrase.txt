DEATH CEREMONIALS.

The time period of usually several months is taken when someone important or a raja dies. The dead body will be kept to recognize all they have done with credits due to them. If a agricultural season is in effect when this happens while others are busy. The corpse will be kept sealed in a wooden structure. They do this by taking a tree and crafting it out of anau due to it's soft nature. They hollow out the inside of two halves of the portion cut. They then take measure of fitting the two peaces together. The workers will take blood of a young hog and sift it onto the wood. The workers will take the flesh as a dessert. The body will be placed into the coffin when it arrives at the house. Before the body is placed in they will have a mat underneath and a cloth on top. If the family can pay for it, camphor is placed all over. After the coffin is closed they bind it with rattans. The will cover it with a a lot of dammar or resin. Sometimes they put a bamboo-tube near the bottom into the ground. The tube will serve  as a channel for the decomposable parts.

When the family and friends are together, each of them will bring a hog, buffalo, goat, dog, some fowl, or something else according to ability. The women usually bring rice within baskets which are placed into an order. The feast will continue on for nine full days, or it will last until all the food is gone. On one of the last days the coffin will be put into an open area surrounded by females on their knees. The women will have their heads covered and howl in sad harmony. The younger kins will dance to the sounding of gongs, kalintangs, and a type of flageolet. Later on during the night the body is taken  home where the seremony continues often including gunshots. The tenth day is when the body is carried to the grave followed by the priest who has his limbs tattooed with images of birds and beasts painted differing colors. He will wear a large wooden mask.
