The multi sided appearance of the exterior is due in part to the smaller tower which once leaned against it, and probably formed the apex of a wing running out from the old castle of the Burggrafs. The Burggr√§fliche Burg stood below, according to Alexander, southwest and west of this point. It was burned down in 1420 during the revolution, and the ruined remains of it are supposed to be traceable in the eminence, now the overgrown landscape, through which a sort of ravine, closed in on either side by built-up walls, has just brought us from the town to the Vestner Thor. 
The Burggraf's Castle would appear to have been so situated as to protect the approach to the Imperial Castle (Kaiserburg). The exact extent of the former we can not now determine. Meisterlin refers to it as a little fort. 

There is no doubt that it reached from the Five-cornered tower to the Walpurgiskapelle. There is reference to a small church set east of the open space called the Freiung, is repeatedly spoken of as being on the property of the Burggrafs. Besides their castle , which was held at first as a fief of the Empire, and afterward came to be regarded as their personal property, the Burggrafs were also entrusted with the keeping of the tower which commanded the entrance to the Castle rock on the country side, perhaps near the site of the present Vestner Thor. One should note the guard door that was attached to the tower, the lower portion of which remains to this day, and is called the Bailiff's Dwelling (Burgamtmannswohnung). The exact relationship of the Burggraf to the town on the one hand, and to the Empire on the other, can be very confusing. Originallyit was believed he was merely an Imperial officer, administering Imperial estates, and looking after Imperial interests. But more recently it is thought he was part of the royal family.
