The patriarch of the home represented the ancestors and had to adhere to certain religious practices and scruples.

He couldn't deviate from the perceived desire of the ancestors because then he'd be disobeying them and committing a major sin.

3)The worshipping community in the early Roman times dictated the relationships in the family because only descendents from the father's side could carry out the rituals.  Married women took on the worship of their husbands' household deities and therefore only those on the male side were family in the complete legal and religious sense.

These observers were called agnates and later, when those on the mother's side were allowed to be recognized, they were called cognates.  At first they still couldn't inherit property.  That meant the family's assets were held together as one bundle by the oldest member in trust for use by the whole family.

That means that the patriarch of the home in earliest times couldn't will property because it would automatically be passed on to the next oldest male heir.

(4) The early Romans considered the marriage ceremony to be of a religious nature.  Through it the bride was initiated into the worship of her new husband's gods and ancestors.

But prior to this, the father of the bride had to release her from the worship of his gods.  Later on a certificate of manumission stating this had to be given, such as when a slave was freed.  Only after this was done could the groom and his wedding party bring her to his father's home.  The resulting ceremony was most like an adoption ritual because the bride was taken into her husband's family through marriage.
