On the walls of the room on the ground floor. 
1. The Annunciation. This, which first meets the eye, is a very fair representative of the whole group, the execution is carried to extreme limits of audacity in line with the ending. Is a fairly well known, and need not therefore be described in particular, but one or two points require notice. The face of the Virgin is very unpleasant for the viewer from below, giving the idea of a woman in her thirties, who had never been beautiful. If the face is intact, is the only case I've seen of Tintoretto in the absence of a desired effect, because, when viewed closely, the face is beautiful and young, and only expresses surprise, instead of pain and fear that looks like the distance.
