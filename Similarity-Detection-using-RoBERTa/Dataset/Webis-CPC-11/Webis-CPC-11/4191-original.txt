The water had risen
to seven feet in the hold. The wind from the westward drove a vast sea before it, and the ship
being old, strained most violently.

On the morning of the 18th nothing could be seen of the Canada, she having pushed on at her
greatest speed for England. The frame of the Ramillies having opened during the night, the
admiral was prevailed upon, by the renewed and pressing remonstrances of the officers, although
with great reluctance, to let six of the forwardmost and four of the aftermost guns of the
main-deck to be thrown overboard, together with the remainder of those on the quarter-deck;
and the ship still continuing to open very much, he ordered tarred canvas and hides to be nailed
fore and aft from under the sills of the ports on the main-deck under the fifth plank above,
or within the water-ways, and the crew, without orders did the same on the lower deck. Her
increasing complaints requiring still more to be done, the admiral directed all the guns on
the upper deck, the shot, both on that and the lower deck, and various heavy stores to be thrown
overboard; a leakage in the light room of the grand magazine having almost filled the ship
forward, and there being eight feet water in the magazine, every gentleman was compelled to
take his turn at the whips, or in handing the buckets. The ship was besides frapped from the
fore-mast to the main-mast.

Notwithstanding their utmost efforts the water still gained on them the succeeding night, the
wind blowing very hard, with extremely heavy squalls, a part of the orlop deck fell into the
hold; the ship herself seemed to work excessively, and to settle forward.

On the morning of the 19th, under these very alarming circumstances, the admiral commanded
both the bower anchors to be cut away, all the junk to be flung overboard, one sheet and one
bower cable to be reduced to junk and served the same way, together with every remaining ponderous
store that could be got at, and all the powder in the grand magazine (it being damaged;) the
cutter and pinnace to be broken up and tossed overboard, the skids having already worked off
the side; every soul on board was now employed in bailing.
