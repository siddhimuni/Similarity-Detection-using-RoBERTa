While they accept that we are valuable in our own way and express themselves adequately, nevertheless they are bound to hate us because love them, and vice versa. Why would they listen to us, provided that they don't get out of hand? What makes us think that they would obey us? A wise woman once said, "that to refuse these considerations is a sign of weakness, and that a true woman would never need to brag about her chastity because she would have never been tempted."

Honor isn't so limited; they may relax ocassionally within their right -- there is some room for error and mistake.  The man who abuses and chastizes a woman is odd indeed if he's dissatisfied with his lot: what he sows is indeed what he reaps. Is it true that your service and morals are esteemed in her heart? Just look to her behavior. You give more by giving less.  The obligation of this goodness is entirely related to the good cheer of he who confers it -- the other mitigating circumstances are entirely irrelevant.  It costs her much more to grant you something so insignificant. If you understand anything, understand this: don't linger on what little is given, but how few can give anything at all.  Currency changes according to time and place.  Whatever some might say to express their anger, goodness will always win in the end. I knew those whose reputations fell greatly through word of mouth and gossip and were soon after restored to their original good name by simply ignoring all of the slander.  Everyone eventually sees the error of their ways and recants the lie that they might once have believed. Someone told Plato that people slandered him -- so he responded "let them talk, I will live in a way that will change their tune."  There is nothing I would hate to do more than give my reputation to those who do not deserve to care for it.  But for those who earn it, to those who become my faithful friends, it is worthwhile.
