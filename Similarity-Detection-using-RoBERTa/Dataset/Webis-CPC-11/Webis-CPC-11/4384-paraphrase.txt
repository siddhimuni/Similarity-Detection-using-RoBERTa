Now, the justice has been made on more attentions than we are competent of making at present; the justice considers a man as competent of bearing any kind and everything but blows. I may reproach a man as much as I please; I may call him a stealer, burglar, traitor, scoundrel, coward, lobster, bloody-back, etc., and if he put to death me it will be slaughter, if none other but remarks precede; but if from giving him such kind of terminology I progress to take him by the nose, or fillip him on the forehead, that is an assault; that is a blow. The justice will not oblige a man to stand still and withstand it; there is the distinction. Hands off; contact me not. As before long as you contact me, if I run you through the heart, it is but manslaughter. The utility of this distinction, the more you consider of it the more you will be gratified with it. It is an assault every time a hard bang is smacked, let it be ever so small, and at times even without a blow. The justice considers man as frail and passionate. When his passions are influenced, he will be flung off his guard, and consequently the justice makes allowance for this frailty --considers him as in a fit of passion, not having the tenure of his sophisticated intellectual might, and consequently does not oblige him to evaluate out his hits with a yard-stick, or weigh them in a scale. Let him put to death with a sword, armament, or hedge-stake, it is not slaughter, but only manslaughter.
(Keyling's Report, 135. Regina versus Mawgrige.) "Rules carried by agency and general approval, presenting what are perpetually sanctioned to be enough provocations. First, if one man upon any remarks will make an assault upon another, either by hauling him by the nose or filliping him on the forehead, and he that is so assaulted will draw his sword and straight away run the other through, that is but manslaughter, for the serenity is broken by the someone murdered and with an indignity to him that accepted the assault. Besides, he that was so affronted might rationally detain that he that treated him in that fashion might have some farther create upon him."

So that here is the boundary, when a man is assaulted and puts to death in aftermath of that assault, it is but manslaughter. I will just read as I depart along the explanation of assault:--
