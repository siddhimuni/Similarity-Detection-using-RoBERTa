As to the nature of this language, it may now be advanced, with some degree of confidence,
that the Cialover owes it origin to a mixture of the Tuscan and of the dialect of the Celtic
spoken by the Lepontii; and that the introduction of the vulgar Roman affected it in some degree,
but particularly gave rise to the Ladin; the vocabulary of which, as any one may be convinced
by inspecting a few lines of the bible, has a great affinity with that of the Latin tongue.
But these assertions rest merely upon historical evidence; for as to the Cialover, all that
it may have retained of the Tuscan or Roman, is so much disfigured by an uncouth pronunciation
and a vague orthography, that all etymological inquiries are thereby rendered intricate and
unsatisfactory. And as to the Ladin, although its derivation be more manifest, yet we are equally
at a loss from what period or branch of the Latin tongue to trace its real origin; for I have
found, after many tedious experiments, that even the vocabulary, in which the resemblance is
most evident, differs equally from the classical purity of Tully, Caesar, and Sallust, as it
does from the primitive Latin of the twelve tables, of Ennius, and the columna rostralis of
Duillius, which has generally been thought the parent of the Gallic Romance; as also from the
trivial language of Varro, Vegetius, and Columella. May we not from this circumstance infer,
that, as is the case in all vernacular tongues, the vulgar dialect of the Romans, the sermo
usualis, rusticus, pedestris,[AG] of which there are no monuments extant, differed very widely
both in pronunciation and construction from that which has at any time been used either in
writing or in the senate?

The grammatical variations, the syntax, and the genius of the language, must in this, as well
as in several other modern European tongues, have been derived from the Celtic; it being well
known, that the frequent use of articles, the distinction of cases by prepositions, the application
of two auxiliaries in the conjugations, do by no means agree with the Latin turn of expression;
although a late French academician[AH] who has taken great pains to prove that the Gallic Romance
was solely derived from the Roman, quotes several instances in which even the most classical
writers have in this respect offended the purity of that refined language.
