"What?"

"The whiskey.  We gave you some whiskey; you were very faint and you felt chilled, so we gave you some."

"Out..of...the...black bottle?"

"Out of the black bottle."

Another silence.

"I think I would like to drink some coffee.  Seeing as how he saved my life, I don't think he would deny me that."

"Well, I'll be, there is a little left."  At once, her father got up and returned with a tin cup containing the requested coffee.  It could have been a part of Miss Amy's rapid convalescence, or it could have been due to her debilitated condition, but no matter which reason, she did not comment on the tin cup.  For a bit, she lay looking about the cabin.  The light of the fire made the colors of the bark floor and thatching seem luxurious, even if it did not look quite so luxurious in the light of day.  The spicy aroma of the wood permeated the room, which Miss Amy welcomed gladly, as opposed to the musty smell she originally expected.  She reminisced about how it was this smell that helped her tolerate an otherwise oily, greasy picnic.  Her father, seeing her raise herself on her elbow, continued with confidence, "Darling, considering you sat up for a bit, it is possible that you have the strength right now to go down to the wagon with me.  It would be a timesaver.

In an instant, Amy was laying down again.  "Papa, what is going through your head?  Honestly, after the shock I went through, I doubt I can stand, let alone walk.  But...well..." she paused, her voice like a wounded bird, "I might just be able to crawl a little bit at a time, if you and Mr. Waterhouse would be willing to help me."

"Of course,  Amy.  Tenbrook, who carried you up here, will carry you back down.  I just thought that since there are steps, they may be coming now.  No!--only HE."

The crackling noise, coming from the underbrush, foretold the darkening of the open cabin door.  The tall figure was that of the mountaineer's.
