Then, sir, he will be in office next week. Peace be with him.  Sugar and cream.

MR. CROTCHET.  But, Doctor, are you for Chainmail Hall on Christmas Day?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  That am I, for there will be an excellent dinner, though, peradventure,
grotesquely served.

MR. CROTCHET.  I have not seen my neighbour since he left us on the canal.

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  He has married a wife, and brought her home.

LADY CLARINDA.  Indeed!  If she suits him, she must be an oddity: it will be amusing to see
them together.

LORD BOSSNOWL.  Very amusing.  He! He!  Mr. Firedamp.  Is there any water about Chainmail Hall?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  An old moat.

MR. FIREDAMP.  I shall die of malaria.

MR. TRILLO.  Shall we have any music?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  An old harper.

MR. TRILLO.  Those fellows are always horridly out of tune.  What will he play?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  Old songs and marches.

MR. SKIONAR.  Among so many old things, I hope we shall find Old Philosophy.

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  An old woman.

MR. PHILPOT.  Perhaps an old map of the river in the twelfth century.

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  No doubt.

MR. MAC QUEDY.  How many more old things?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  Old hospitality; old wine; old ale; all the images of old England; an old
butler.

MR. TOOGOOD.  Shall we all be welcome?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  Heartily; you will be slapped on the shoulder, and called Old Boy.

LORD BOSSNOWL.  I think we should all go in our old clothes.  He! He!

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  You will sit on old chairs, round an old table, by the light of old lamps,
suspended from pointed arches, which, Mr. Chainmail says, first came into use in the twelfth
century, with old armour on the pillars and old banners in the roof.

LADY CLARINDA.  And what curious piece of antiquity is the lady of the mansion?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  No antiquity there; none.

LADY CLARINDA.  Who was she?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  That I know not.

LADY CLARINDA.  Have you seen her?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  I have.

LADY CLARINDA.  Is she pretty?

REV. DR. FOLLIOTT.  More,--beautiful.  A subject for the pen of Nonnus or the pencil of Zeuxis.
Features of all loveliness, radiant with all virtue and intelligence.  A face for Antigone.
A form at once plump and symmetrical, that, if it be decorous to divine it by externals, would
have been a model for the Venus of Cnidos.  Never was anything so goodly to look on, the present
company excepted; and poor dear Mrs. Folliott.
