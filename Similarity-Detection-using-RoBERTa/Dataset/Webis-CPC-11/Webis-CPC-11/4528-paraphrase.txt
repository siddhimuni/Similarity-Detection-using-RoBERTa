It was on this occasion to the extraordinary sight of men who tried in shackles witnessed, and that representatives of the English Crown came to sit to convict the men remain innocent in the eyes of the law, but cuffed and convicted criminals. Blistered plates together tightly around his wrists Irish prisoners stood for justice - justice as torturing the men first and treat continuous - you could give to them. "The police took the necessary precaution," said the judge, in response to scathing denunciations of unprecedented attack that fell from the lips of Ernest Jones, a lawyer for the detainees. Police have found it necessary, even within the court is no friend of the accused could dare to show his face - despite all the building bristling with soldiers and policemen with their guns demonstratively shows - this is necessary, but each approach to the palace Justice was in the hands of an armed guard and, although all soldiers throughout the city was to arms - is necessary, in the heart of an English city with a high population density thirst for the blood of the accused, and when The danger seemed to be, not that they could escape from prison - a flight to the Moon is only possible - but they could be slaughtered in cold blood by the angry mob that English scowled at them from the galleries of the Palace of Justice and howled around the building where they were.

Middle of applause from the large body representing the British public in the courthouse, insisted that wives must be on and then Mr. Jones, the only one left for a man of spirit in the circumstances, he threw his brief and outraged justice room left desecrated.
