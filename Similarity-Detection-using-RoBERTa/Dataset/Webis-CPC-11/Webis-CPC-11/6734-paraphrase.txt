The young person's anomaly,as presented everyday,who knows nothing, feels nothing and has nothing to communicateother than the communication desire,who never rushes upon the stage is felt to be absurd.The aspirant finds his level when the curb of commonsense is recognized by the impulse,where the instinct and the faculty exists.Thus the recruition of dramatic expresion takes place.Thus, several kinds of dramatic artist-each being distinct and expression of a sequence is maintained fron spiritual and mental ancestry.

It is clear that each capricious chance is being operated silently and surely by a natural law,in life's conduct.A stock company, which is thoroughly adequate and dramatic will be considered as a thing of natural accretion.It is formed of every group of people,the old, middle-aged and the young,but must have the capacity to present each elemental type of human nature in a concrete image.It is essential to reproduce even the delicate exaggeration to dramatic art. Every type of person,in order of the human life,whether of the street, the dwelling, the court,the camp,man during his common joys and sorrows,his vices, crimes, miseries,his loftiest aspirationsor the most ideal state,everything may be copied as it is,so that the picture will expressits beauty, sweetness,happiness, mirth,dignity, moral admonition and significance to benefit the world.This dramatic stock company , for example(commendable products of the modern age)has grown up. It has crystallised into a form of refined power and symmetry,maintaining the purpose, for which it is devoted.It is under the management of Augustn Daly.

 In 1869,Mr.Daly began management,whose purpose was to act comedy,who has continued remaining in it.Most of the players have served under his direction, whose company has known vicissitudes.The comprehensive form,its competent force and its most attractive quality like the essential grace has not been lost by the organisation.It was difficult for any observer of its career to fail to percieve the promptness of the manager to learn by experience.He has to make keen perception to the essential constituents of a theatrical troop.He has to use the forces at his disposal with fine judgement.He has to animate their spiritand guide their art with intrepid resolution and expeditious energy.He has naturally positioned the players and grouped into one artistic family.

The company  was well balanced, finely equipped and distinctively able.The resources of poetry,thought , character, taste,humour and general capacitymay not be appreciated during their viewing."Non, si male nunc,et olim sic erit".After fifty years from now,if, by chance,some veteran , who is still bright and cheery"in the chimney nook of age",sitting in his armchair,happens to remind of the past,with what complacement exultation,would he speak of the beautiful Ada Rehan,so attractive as Peggy in The Country Girl,so bright, vehementand stormily loving as Katherine,of manly John Drew,who has a nonchalant ease, incisive tonewith crisp and graceful method,of Charles Fisher, who was noble,James Lewis,who was sprightly and sparkling and strange Mrs.Gilbert,who was genial ands piquant.

In that aged reminescent voice,the gentle triumph is marked by me.I can also respect an old man's kindly and natural sympathy with the glories and delights of his youth which is vanished.But today, it is unnecessary to wait to become old to praise anything and only the dead.In our own time, we should recognize what is good. We should honour and admire it with grateful hearts.

NOTE-At the Garrick club,London,June26,1885,I was fortunate to meetMr. Fladgate,"father of the Garrick",aged 86.It was astonishing that he remembered and talked about the actors of the Kemble period.He feltJohn Philip Kemble to be the greatest of actors. He said his best impersonations werePenruddock,Zanga and Coriolanus.According to him,Mrs. Siddon swas incomparable,the elder Mathews was a great genius-the precursor of Dickens.He was not interested in Edmund Kean, but said he was best in Sir Edward Mortimer and afterwards , in Shylock.He remembered Miss O'Neilto be the perfect Julietand Lady Wrixon Becher,who was a beautiful blue eyed woman,who weeps easilyand retained her beauty to the last and died at 85.
