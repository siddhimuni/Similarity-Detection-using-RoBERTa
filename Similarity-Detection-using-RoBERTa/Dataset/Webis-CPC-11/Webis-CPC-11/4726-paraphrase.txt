AMERICAN WAR- ENGINES
      There was a probability of a general war in Europe So there lay  an unusal interest  in this subject. America has made many improvements in every type of war engines. There was a necessity of repeating weapons  which was very long ago admitted. Ccommunications are made with the a historical account of rotaing chamber fire-arms which were discovered by the  author after a lot of reserach made on early efforts of the armorers.  It is remarkable that Only a very few came successful in producing serviceable weapons.The tower of London, the United Service Museu,, the Rotunda at Woolwich, warwick Castle, the Musee d' Artilerie, and the Hotel Cluny, at Paris, and some ancient Eastern arms brought from India by Lord William Bentinck, are the places where the early efforts of rapidly firing equipments  are demonstrated. These equipments are  capable of firing several times without the delay of loading after each discharge.The drawings of these specimens comprises the match-lock,the pyrites wheel-lock, down tothe percussion-lock guns as used by the author.The match-lock guns and pyrites wheel-lock guns had as many as eight chambers and rotated by hand. One made in the seventeenth century had  a peculiar feature as that of modern prussian "needle gun"  igniting the charge close behind the bullet, burning backwards towards the breech.The flint -locks is more effective but all were abortive ,as the magazines for priming and the pan covers were repeatedly blown off on the explosion  of the charge. But as in the ancient times today also it is difficult for simultaneous ignition fo the charges from the spreading of the fire at their mouths.In some ancient specimens orfices are there in the butt of the barrel to escape of the bullets in case of explosion to avoid distruction by this action.
