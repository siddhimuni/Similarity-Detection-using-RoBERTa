I followed and back and back heel through gates and barbed wire fence building, at which time he commanded "Continue."

I asked "Where?"

"Straight" he said angrily.

I did. "Left!" he cried. I came back. A door facing me. "Entre" commanded. I did. Unremarkable looking for a gentleman in a French uniform, sitting at a table way. "Monsieur them MÃ©decin Le Nouveau." The doctor got up. "Open your shirt." I did. "He pants." I did. "Okay." Then, as planton was going to escort me from the room: "English?" he asked curiously. "No," I said, "American." "Vraiment" - my carefully planned. "South America are you?" "United States" I explained. "Vraiment" - he looked at me funny, not at disagreeably. "Pourquoi etes vous ICI?"
