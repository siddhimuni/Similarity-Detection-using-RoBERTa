There is no statistical account of England recently published, that we can discover, which
would give us any correct idea of the present average rent of land in this country;[31] but
we think, from all the information we have been able to acquire, by enquiries directed to competent
and well-informed persons, that it cannot be set down at less than 25s. an acre. From the last
Irish census we learn, that Ireland contains 20,399,608 statute acres, and that the estimated
rental is L12,715,478--yielding a trifle over 12s. as the average rent.[32] When it is taken
into consideration that the English tenant pays tithes--which, in many localities, amount to
more than the entire average rent produced by Irish ground; that he pays the poor-rates, and
that he is heavily taxed with turnpikes and other local assessments: and that the Irish tenant
pays no tithe, and only half the poor-rates; that no turnpikes exist, except solitary ones
in the neighbourhood of cities or very large towns; that, in fact, the only tax he pays is
the county cess, varying in different counties from tenpence to one and sixpence the acre half-yearly;
and that this assessment is being considerably reduced by the new grand-jury enactments, under
which the towns and gentlemen's houses are valued and taxed;--when, we say, all those things
are taken into consideration, and besides, that the land in Ireland is naturally better and
more productive than the English soil, we think we have satisfactorily disposed of one grave
charge against the Irish landlords; and that we have shown that it cannot be the exorbitance
of the pecuniary burdens under which he groans, that causes the vast difference between the
social condition of the Irish and the English occupier.

It will no doubt be said--"Ah, but the English tenant is housed, and his farm kept in repair,
by the landlord, while the Irishman is obliged to do all this himself!" This is true; but certainly
the outlay of the Irish tenant on his farm, makes but a small addition to his other engagements.
Gates and fences he has, comparatively speaking, none; and, if they be erected for him, they
are soon suffered to go to ruin.
