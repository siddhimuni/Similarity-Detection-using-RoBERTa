Crazed, the saddened manager hurried away to the steam-packet office, where he was favored by an inspection of the books, which agreed with the hateful tidings.  To make matters worse, when he got home, he found a not from Mr. Gotobed telling him about an actress named Sophy Waife, hinting "that the visit might prove to his advantage!"  Thinking for a moment that Mr. Losely might through his solicitor pay back his L100, re hurried to Mr. Gotobed's office.

"I'm sorry sir," Mr. Gotobed started politely, "but I heard through the grapevine that you were exhibiting a young actress by the name of Juliet Araminta at Humberston, whom you previously exhibited in Surrey, but she was supposed to have relinquished that engagement and left with her Grandfather, William Waife.  I have been tasked by a wealthy client to find their residence.  Should anything happen to the juvenile, you will be compensated.

Rugge cried, "I paid L100 for her. Reimburse me and I will gladly give you her address and her grandfather's."

"You want me to pay for her? Is she your property?"

"Yes, as a matter of fact, she is."

"You cannot deliver her directly to me?  How can I be sure she is even alive?"

"She is.  She is in America, or at least on her way to it."

"Are you sure?"

"Positive.  I just saw her name in the books.  She left from Liverpool last Thursday."

"They robbed you. These are bad people."

"Bad would be an understatement," Rugge insisted. He began to cry softly, "I was more than a father to her. I had hoped maybe she could live the life that my own child never had the chance to."

Having recieved the information he wanted, Mr. Gotobed pulled out his watch and seemed to study it carefully.

"I am sorry for your loss, Mr. Rugge, but I have a meeting in the City. I cannot reimburse you for your L100, but I can offer you this."  He pulled out a L5 note and carelessly tossed it to Mr. Rugge.  Mr. Gotobed rang the bell violently.  "Please show Mr. Rugge to the door now."
