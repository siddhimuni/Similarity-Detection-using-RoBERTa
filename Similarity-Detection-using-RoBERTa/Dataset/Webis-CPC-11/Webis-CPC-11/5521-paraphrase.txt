Above the crash of the ocean and the whistle of the wind, Uruj could hear the shrieks of the miserable slaves as their taskmasters' whips tore through their skin and flesh: the slave rowed stark naked chained to his bench in this loathsome environment. This was his fate; he was well aware of the truth.

After nightfall, at last, the ship anchored under the Isle of Castel Rosso and reached the entrance of the Gulf of Satalie. It still blew intense, but in the corresponding peace of the anchorage, sounds otherwise hidden had now made themselves manifest. There were the snores of the snoozers and the clank of the leg-chains as the hapless slaves shifted their positions in the attempt to gain an easier place on the bench.  There was also the sound of men raising Cane with loud laughter in the stern of the vessel - stark contrast from the hollow groaning in mortal agony above them. This emanated from a slave who was rather close to Uruj. There came a spell in the merriment in the stern.  "That noise disturbs me; see that it ceases at once," spoke an overbearing voice.  "It shall cease at once, Your Eminence."  The petulant wretch was freed from his shackles and then thrown overboard.

As the weather worsened, the ship followed.  This awoke the slaves.  Uruj in particular was able to remove his shackles, an amiss bolt permitting him access.  For Uruj, it was do or die.  He was a brazen swimmer, after all.  By a miracle, he touched dry land and eventually made his way to Egypt.  There, he took service as a mariner in a ship where he experienced many hardships on the sea.

Uruj was soon acknowledged by the Governor of Caramania, Khorkud, as an audacious mariner.  The Governor ordered Uruj to provide him a ship fitted for war against the same Christians that attacked Uruj's ship.  For his troubles, Uruj was rewarded 5,000 ducats in compliance to the Governor's ulterior motives.
