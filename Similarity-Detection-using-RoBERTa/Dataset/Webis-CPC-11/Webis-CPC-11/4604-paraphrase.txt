IS THE PREPUCE A NATURAL PHYSIOLOGICAL APPENDAGE? 

By several surgeons the thought of circumcision, unless linked by an instant require for interference,--such as a phimosis uncontrollable by some other way, an induced phimosis from gonorrhea or other frustration, syphilis in its initiatory aching, tumor or a few such reason,--is looked ahead as an unwarrantable process, a method not only barbarous, aching, and hazardous, but one that directly interferes by means of the intention of environment. The prepuce is by several look upon as a physiological need to fitness and the satisfaction of life, which, if detached, is responsible to make masturbation, too much venereal wish, and a train of added harms. The query then resolve itself, what is the actual physiological position of this addition, if it have some, and, if it is a physiological addition, when does it combine into a pathological appendage? As by various it is seized that the prepuce enjoy the similar right to exist and live as the nose, ear, or a limb, which are only topic to elimination in case of a severe illness, they must be reminded that they are not captivating into concern that the nose and ear are intended to advise us of risk, and that our legs are extremely helpful; as yet the great presenter Demosthenes, by the appropriate and quick use of his legs, was enabled to flee from a encounter, where his oratory was of no benefit against the uneducated javelins of the unscholarly Macedonians. If the prepuce only was gifted with an olfactory intelligence,--as, for example, if a anxious thread from the primary duo of nerves had been sent down alongside of the pneumogastric and then, by following the path of the mammary and epigastric arteries, had at last reached the prepuce, where the olfactory intelligence might have been twisted on at determination, similar to an luminous light,--it may have been a awfully practical organ, as in that intelligence it could have scented hazard from afar, if not from near, and enabled man to keep away from any of the numerous dangers into which he unconsciously drops. But, considering that the prepuce, to speak nothing of being neither nose, eye, nor ear to advise one away from risk, or a leg to run away on after once in it, having not even the defensive sensitiveness of a cat's moustachios, it cannot, in any method that we can observe, be compared to several other useful component of the body.
