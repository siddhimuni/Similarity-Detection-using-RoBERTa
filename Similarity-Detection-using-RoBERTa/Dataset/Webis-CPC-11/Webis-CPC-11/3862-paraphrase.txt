Place the electroscope on the surface plate (or at least on a piece of plate glass).  Place a scribing block next to it and adjust the scriber so you can dip it into the kerosene to the depth that you need.  You can do this by twisting some wire around the scribing point so that it points down.  The scribing point gives you an idea of how high the vessel can be filled.  Adjust the liquid until it touches the tip of the scribing point; by doing so, the wire forms an electrode of constant surface area.  Put the scribing block down, giving a charge to the electroscope; then note the amount of time it takes for the given amount of collapse of the leaves.  

Next, replace the kerosene with paraffin or vaseline, which insulate relatively well.  Then repeat the process, noting the amount of time for the same amount of collapse of the leaves.  Although this test produces approximate results, it is usually adequate and appropriate for workshop environments, especially since it is easily carried out.  Also, unlike with the use of more complex means, this experiment does not require adjustment for electrometer leakage.  

Quantitative tests aren't valuable unless they are extraordinarily complex, since the real resistance of insulating oils is dependent on electrical intensity, its duration, and the direction of the voltage that it was subjected to in the past, as well as the influences of even small amounts of moisture.
