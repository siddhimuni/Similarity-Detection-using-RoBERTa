I was not alarmed for I did not think I have done anything wrong; nevertheless, I avoided public places and talking to people altogether - every time I was in a crowd, I would suddenly become horrified without a particular reason.

In the evening, as it got darker, I finally reached my destination, and all the worrisome thoughts have left me at once. I met my beloved - she was already waiting for me when I arrived - and was completely smitten by her gentle looks. Her departure did not resemble mine in the least: she left her parent's home without saying a word about her plans, and only when she did not come back at lunch time her family could have known that she had fled.

We have exchanged our stories, and she had had a harder time finding a way to follow our plan. Afraid of rejection, she had not shared the news with a single soul, even Magdalene was left ignorant. She had to pretend that everything was as usual and dine in the common room, and listen to the every day mundane discussions at breakfast. She left for her daily walk a little earlier than usual, but it did not cause any alarm. After spending five or so minutes hiding in the barn she sneaked back into the house, fetched some of her belongings that she could not bear to leave, and had taken to the city.
