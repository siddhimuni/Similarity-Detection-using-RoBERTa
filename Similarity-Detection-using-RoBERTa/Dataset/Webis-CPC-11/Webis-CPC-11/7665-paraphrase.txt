(Someone grabbed the hat and held it out to JOE, who, surprisingly enough, defers the receipt to the hands of the deputy.) Don't overlook him, Good Sirs! (Pennies flood into the hat, and the last round is on; B. of B. dodging JOE's punches deftly, and landing at will his own on various parts of JOE's corpus.)

From the Audience: That man will be KO'd in just a minute, that's for sure! He doesn't seem to be able to get close enough to hurt the fellow anyhow. Look at that--oh, and again! Well, JOE got one in that time--but that B. of B. is the better pugilist. He doesn't touch you without hurting you, you know what I mean?
