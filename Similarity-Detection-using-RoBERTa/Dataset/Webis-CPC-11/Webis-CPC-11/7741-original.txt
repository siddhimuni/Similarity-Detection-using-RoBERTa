He besought her, held out his hands to her, and did
not dare to touch her. 'What do you want me to do ... to convince you?'

She glanced at him again.

'Tell me, Monsieur Dimitri,' she began; 'the day before yesterday, when you came to talk to
me, you did not, I imagine, know then ... did not feel ...'

'I felt it,' Sanin broke in; 'but I did not know it. I have loved you from the very instant
I saw you; but I did not realise at once what you had become to me! And besides, I heard that
you were solemnly betrothed.... As far as your mother's request is concerned--in the first
place, how could I refuse?--and secondly, I think I carried out her request in such a way that
you could guess....'

They heard a heavy tread, and a rather stout gentleman with a knapsack over his shoulder, apparently
a foreigner, emerged from behind the clump, and staring, with the unceremoniousness of a tourist,
at the couple sitting on the garden-seat, gave a loud cough and went on.

'Your mother,' Sanin began, as soon as the sound of the heavy footsteps had ceased, 'told me
your breaking off your engagement would cause a scandal'--Gemma frowned a little--that I was
myself in part responsible for unpleasant gossip, and that ... consequently ... I was, to some
extent, under an obligation to advise you not to break with your betrothed, Herr Klueber....'

'Monsieur Dimitri,' said Gemma, and she passed her hand over her hair on the side turned towards
Sanin, 'don't, please, call Herr Klueber my betrothed. I shall never be his wife. I have broken
with him.'

'You have broken with him? when?'

'Yesterday.'

'You saw him?'

'Yes. At our house. He came to see us.'

'Gemma? Then you love me?'

She turned to him.
