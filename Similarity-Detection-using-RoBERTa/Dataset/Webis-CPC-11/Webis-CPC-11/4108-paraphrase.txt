we shall not interfere with the anatomical tailors whose science that we will not  understand. Also not about the Greek tailors as we are not free to take such liberty.We shall not meddle with Hebrew tailors either as we are only gentile ourselves.Our aim is to introduce  a person whose name is Mr.Mcdonald and is a neighbour of ours,  who does does not mix up with science and only know his mother tongue which is broad Scotch.  He wanted to be a master in his craft.  At that time some thoretical mode of cutting was there to make the coat fit like a second skin. Our neighbour had a practical thinking. So he proceeded with a mew method to keep up with the competition between his fellow craftsmen. In his opinion the essential thing required to make a perfect suit is an accurate apparatus to measure the human figure, rather than principles and theories. Thus he made a new machine which measures human figure accuratley We only able to watch the machine a few days ago even though the machine received a great favour when exhibited in the school of art some time ago.
      The machine is made with three perpendicular pieces of wood , the centre one with six to seven feet high and a plinth to stand upon.It is marked from top to bottom with inches and subdivisions of inch, and with slides fitting closely but movable if the operator think so. The appearance of a man when he places himself in the machine resembles the crucifixation except instead of extended arms they hang motionless by his sides with the fingers pointed.
