Was it disaster or simply a benign circumstance? Whatever the case was, it occured in a flash. Afterwards, their hands parted quickly. With furtive, guilty, glances at each other the two men parted ways, diverging to either ends of the crowded concourse as if they'd never met and shared that brief flash of 'something'. In that brief moment in time, it was possible that all was lost and the secret betrayed.

Cleotos turned to Enone and said, "I think I recognized that gentleman." He was curious about her response, as he had noticed that she had also scrutinized the man carefully and with some signs of recognition.

"Who do you think he is," Enone asked. 

"I believe that he is the man named Clemens. Clemens was the leader of a Christian group in Corinth when I met him there near two years ago. He is in fact the one who provided me with the good words I have inscribed upon my paper at this very moment. I do not know why he is risking his safety to be here in such a public place."

"I'd like that paper for myself, if you please, Cleotos."

Cleotos was instantly afraid. Afraid that she might wield her authority over him to confiscate that small scrap of paper that held the words he had found to be so dear. Their promise of a better life for the future had often brought him comfort and joy in the past. Had her previous companionship been naught but a facade?

"Don't be afraid, dear Cleotos," she said in response to his visible tension. "I just want to have the comfort of holding onto the same words that brought you so much joy when you have gone on and left me behind."
