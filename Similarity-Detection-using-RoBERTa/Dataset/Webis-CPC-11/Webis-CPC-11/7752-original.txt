Although this luxurious picture may be drawn in too-warm tints
it is not however without its degree of justness. The people of the country are fond of flowers
in the ornament of their persons, and encourage their growth, as well as that of various odoriferous
shrubs and trees.

KANANGA.

The kananga (Uvaria cananga, L.) being a tree of the largest size, surpassed by few in the
forest, may well take the lead, on that account, in a description of those which bear flowers.
These are of a greenish yellow, scarcely distinguishable from the leaves, among which the bunches
hang down in a peculiar manner. About sunset, if the evening be calm, they diffuse a fragrance
around that affects the sense at the distance of some hundred yards.

CHAMPAKA.

Champaka (Michelia champaca). This tree grows in a regular, conical shape, and is ornamental
in gardens. The flowers are a kind of small tulip, but close and pointed at top; their colour
a deep yellow, the scent strong, and at a distance agreeable. They are wrapped in the folds
of the hair, both by the women, and by young men who aim at gallantry.

TANJONG.

Bunga tanjong (Mimusops elengi, L.) A fair tree, rich in foliage, of a dark green; the flowers
small, radiated, of a yellowish white, and worn in wreaths by the women; their scent, though
exquisite at a distance, is too powerful when brought nigh. The fruit is a drupe, containing
a large blackish flatted seed.

GARDENIA.

Sangklapa (Gardenia flore simplice).
