There is certain thing to be said supportive the suggestion, and it is a shame that the deserves of the inquiry should have been rather obscured by the intolerable, but to some individuals possibly appealing, proposal that the added expenditure essential for producing learning gratuitous should be provided by the robbery of the Church, or (in politer phrase) by the appropriation to the reasons of learning of the nationwide house hitherto provided to the support of religion. This feline can scarcely be said to have been let out of the bag, for her head was no earlier glimpsed peeping out than the alert conceived was unsafely large, and Puss was hid afresh in a twinkling; but she is interior the bag still. A much less objectionable suggestion was speedily made, namely, that the deficiency conceived by the remission of school-pence should be provided by a Parliamentary grant. And this suggestion, we presume, may be considered as at present before the country. 
Looking upon the issue from a Chancellor of the Exchequer issue of outlook, it is a grave thing to believe of having to make an supplement of about two millions to the yearly nationwide expenditure; and it may be discerned that premier statesmen on both edges of government may be discovered who are at present unconvinced. Doubtless an expenditure of two millions would not be grudged by the territory for any essential purpose; but when the suggestion is to alternate a fee of two millions by the Exchequer for the two millions paid in driblets by the individuals most involved, for the most part gladly and with exceptional provisions for stopping the fee pushing barely upon the exceptionally poor, it may well be that numerous shrewd individuals will inquire the inquiry, Cui bono- 

Independently, although, of any fiscal concerns, it appears to us that there are weighty contentions contrary to the suggestion of a gratuitous education. 

It may be discerned, and we believe it an significant fact, that the suggestion of free learning is in the teeth of all our latest policy; and some pushing causes should to be granted for a entire and rapid reversal of all that we have hitherto been doing. There are numerous free schools in the homeland, endowed by 'pious founders,' and established for the exceptional reason of giving free learning to the young children of specific parishes.
