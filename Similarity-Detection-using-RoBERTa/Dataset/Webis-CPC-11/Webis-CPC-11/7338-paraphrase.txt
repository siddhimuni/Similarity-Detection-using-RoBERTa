Your Saturday newspaper arrived here at 4:00 Saturday afternoon, May 13th, and, as indicated by the evidence presented to the coroner, a number of individuals left Auburn to accomplish the same task but each without the other's knowledge or collaboration.

Two of the persons were Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham, AKA "Black Bart". Gillson ran a saloon at the intersection of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and Black Bart was employed by Conrad and Company, custodians of the Norfolk Livery Stable. Gillson was son-in-law to ex-Governor Roberts of Iowa, and is survived by a wife and two children, victims of his untimely demise. As for Mr. Graham, nothing is known of a surviving family.

It has been suggested that he was involved in the late robbery of Wells and Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he gambled constantly. One fact was well known to be true: he had a commission as a lieutenant in the Confederate Army, and served under General Price and the renegade Quantrell.  He had the benefit of a fine education in his youth, was from a good family, and displayed acceptable manners, but he seemed to have acquired a drinking problem at an early age, eventually leading to degradation and a ruinous life. But he was not incapable of generous, or, rather, self-serving romantic deeds. It was during the burning of Putnam House here summer of last year that he saved two women from the fires. In the process, he burned his left hand so severely that the tendons of two fingers contracted permanently, and the associated scarring may indeed make his apprehension easier.
