What we try to do with blasts of chlorine, nature does on a large scale with the use of atmospheric electricity.

"In this way among others we find that nature can do two different things with one action.  When the oxidizable miasma are destroyed by the ozone in the atmosphere, they in turn cause the destruction of the latter.  That's probably why
we don't get an excess of atmospheric ozone that's higher in proportion to the oxidizable miasma, even though both are constantly being formed.

"It's always been thught that a storm will help purify the atmosphere, and this may be true.  We do know that a storm produces more ozone.  It may be quite likely that the relation between it and the oxidizable miasma may be off so that the latter won't be totally destroyed.  They would then cause chemical imbalance and problems for animals and creatures who breathe the air that's been infected.

However, there are many experiments to show that
the air contains enough free ozones that an oxidizable miasma can't live in it, as it couldn't live in air that had even a bit of chlorine.

"I don't know if it's also true, as people like Mr. Hunt have said, that there isn't enough ozone in the atmosphere whenever there's a plague such as cholera.
