Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming and Nevada enacted or amended
eight-hour measures for employees in mines, but little was accomplished for children in the
Southern States.[1]

The labor-injunction question has been recently covered by an admirable study prepared by the
Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics and published in December, 1909. The investigation covers
eleven years, from 1898 to 1908, in which there occurred two thousand and two strikes. In sixty-six
of these strikes the employers sought injunctions and in forty-six cases injunctions were actually
issued. In only nine cases were there proceedings for contempt of these injunctions, while
only in two cases out of the two thousand were there any convictions for contempt of court.
In eighteen cases injunctions were sought to prevent employees from striking, but only in four
of these were they granted, and one of these was later dissolved. Seven bills were brought
by employees against unions for interference with their employment, etc., and in three cases
unions sought injunctions against other unions. In one case a union brought a bill against
an employer and in one case an employer sought an injunction against an employers' association.
Under a decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court it was declared unlawful for a trade-union
to impose fines upon those of its members who refused to obey its orders to strike or engage
in a boycott.
