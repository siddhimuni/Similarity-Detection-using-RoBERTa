Isabella's father was very tall and straight, when young, which gave him the name of 'Bomefree'-low
Dutch for tree-at least, this is SOJOURNER's pronunciation of it-and by this name he usually
went.  The most familiar appellation of her mother was 'Mau-mau Bett.'  She was the mother
of some ten or twelve children; though Sojourner is far from knowing the exact number of her
brothers and sisters; she being the youngest, save one, and all older than herself having been
sold before her remembrance.  She was privileged to behold six of them while she remained a slave.

Of the two that immediately preceded her in age, a boy of five years, and a girl of three,
who were sold when she was an infant, she heard much; and she wishes that all who would fain
believe that slave parents have not natural affection for their offspring could have listened
as she did, while Bomefree and Mau-mau Bett,-their dark cellar lighted by a blazing pine-knot,-would
sit for hours, recalling and recounting every endearing, as well as harrowing circumstance
that taxed memory could supply, from the histories of those dear departed ones, of whom they
had been robbed, and for whom their hearts still bled.  Among the rest, they would relate how
the little boy, on the last morning he was with them, arose with the birds, kindled a fire,
calling for his Mau-mau to 'come, for all was now ready for her'-little dreaming of the dreadful
separation which was so near at hand, but of which his parents had an uncertain, but all the
more cruel foreboding.  There was snow on the ground, at the time of which we are speaking;
and a large old-fashioned sleigh was seen to drive up to the door of the late Col. Ardinburgh.
This event was noticed with childish pleasure by the unsuspicious boy; but when he was taken
and put into the sleigh, and saw his little sister actually shut and locked into the sleigh
box, his eyes were at once opened to their intentions; and, like a frightened deer he sprang
from the sleigh, and running into the house, concealed himself under a bed.
