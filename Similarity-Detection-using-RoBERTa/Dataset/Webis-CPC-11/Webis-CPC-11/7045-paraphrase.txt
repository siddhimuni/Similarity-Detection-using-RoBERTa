You quote evidence from the press and our public speakers, that the righteous indignation against Slavery which once flamed brightly in all English hearts has declined, and even that it has died out completely; you also claim that our faith in, and sympathy for, the North engaged in this great struggle is sadly lacking, and even fallen so low as to approve of, even if not to actively aid, the South. This is too much, despite all the debates that have been held on the complicated motives which have become entwined in this war, along with all other human concerns, and on the occasional acts of questionable spirit which must inevitably attend the public policy and sentiments of a nation engaged in deadliest conflict and bleeding from every pore

Prehaps it is possible to forgive those who do not give their full support, anxious that such a moral cause should be maintained with no tainted motives and only the most inflexible integrity, and yet have failed to read in your policy the absolute desire to bring to fulfillment the end of universal emancipation to where Providence is visibly directing the course of events

To some extent, forgiveness should also be given  to those who have been misled by the misrepresentations of a portion of our press, and offended by your own inimical spirit.

But, Madam, although you may have been disappointed not to hear the words of blessing so rightfully expected, and though the voice of England which has reached you has lacked that full tone of heartfelt sympathy you had justly anticipated, do not believe not that our nation is truly alienated from yours, or that we have betrayed the great principles of freedom which were once our glory.
