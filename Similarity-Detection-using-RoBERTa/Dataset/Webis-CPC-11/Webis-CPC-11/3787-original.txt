Gladly would the son
of the Red Elk have remained for ever with his beloved in the happy island, but the words of
the Master of Life came to him in the pauses of the breeze, saying--

"Go back to thy own land, hunter. Your time has not yet come. You have not yet performed the
work I have for you to do, nor can you yet enjoy those pleasures which belong to them who have
performed their allotted task on earth. Go back, then. In time thou shalt rejoin her, the love
of whom has brought thee hither."

MACHINITOU, THE EVIL SPIRIT.

Chemanitou, being the Master of Life, at one time became the origin of a spirit that has ever
since caused him and all others of his creation a great deal of disquiet. His birth was owing
to an accident. It was in this wise:--

Metowac, or as the white people now call it, Long Island, was originally a vast plain, so level
and free from any kind of growth that it looked like a portion of the great sea that had suddenly
been made to move back and let the sand below appear, which was, in fact, the case.

Here it was that Chemanitou used to come and sit when he wished to bring any new creation to
life. The place being spacious and solitary, the water upon every side, he had not only room
enough, but was free from interruption.

It is well known that some of these early creations were of very great size, so that very few
could live in the same place, and their strength made it difficult for even Chemanitou to control
them, for when he has given them certain powers they have the use of the laws that govern those
powers, till it is his will to take them back to himself. Accordingly it was the custom of
Chemanitou, when he wished to try the effect of these creatures, to set them in motion upon
the island of Metowac, and if they did not please him, he took the life away from them again.
