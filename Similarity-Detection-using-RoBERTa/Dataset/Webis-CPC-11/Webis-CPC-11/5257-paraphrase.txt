She was too convulse by her many emotion and shouting opinion to think of defending herself. 
Salina, in the drawing-room, diligently finger and classed brown-black pressed weeds of her neophyte's botany-folios. The sight of her and her occupation struck Amanita as that of a person in another world beyond this world of blood, oddly substantial to view; and one heard her speak. 
Guilty?--no. But she had wished to interest her lord. After the term of a length of months, could it be that the unhappy man and she were punished for the half-minute's acting of some interest in him? And Lord Ormond had been seen consulting Captain May; or was it giving him directions? 
Her head burned. All the barren interrogation were up, running and knocking for hollow responses; and, saving a paleness of face, she cloaked any small show of the riot. She was an friendly hostess. She had ceased to understand Mrs. Lawrence, even to the degree of thinking her unfeminine. She should have known that the 'angelical chimpanzee,' as a friend, once told of his being a favorite with the lady, had called her, could not simulate a feeling, and had not the slightest power of pretence to compassion for an ill-fated person who failed to quicken her enthusiasm. In that, too, she was a complete boy. Mossfield was a kind of Bedlamite to her; amusing in his antics, and requiring being maneuvered and eluded while he lived: once dead, just a tombstone, of interest only to his family. 
She beckon Amanita to follow her; and, with a smirk of kind fun, commended Lord Adder wood to a study of Salina Collette’s botany-folios, which the urbanism of indifferent gentlemen had slid his eyes over his nose to check before the lunch. 
'You ought to know what is going on in town, my dear Amanita. You have won the earl to a sense of his duty, and he’s at work on the harder task of winning Lady Charlotte Eaglet to a sense of hers. It’s tremendous. Has been forward some days, and no sign of yielding on either side. Mr. Eaglet, good man, is between them, catching it right and left; and he deserves his luck for marrying her. Vows she makes him the best of wives. If he’s content, I 'vex nothing to complain of. You must be ready to receive her; my lord is sure to carry the day. You gulp. You won't be seeing much of her. I 'm glad to say he is condescending to terms of peace with the Horse Guards. We hear so. You may be thronging it officially somewhere next year. And all’s well that ends well! Say that to me!' 
'It is, when the end comes,' Amanita replied. 
Mrs. Lawrence's cool lips were pressed to her cheek. The couple and their waterman rowed away to the party they had left with the four-in- hand at their inn. 
A wind was rising. The trees gave their swish of leaves, the river darkened the patch of wrinkles, the bordering flags amid the reed-blades dipped and streamed. 
Surcharged with unassimilated news of events, that made a thunder in her head, Amanita walked down the garden path, meeting Salina and bearing her on. She had a witch's will to rouse gales. Hers was not the woman's nature to be driven cowering by stories of men's bloody deeds. She took the field, revolted, dissevering herself from the class which tolerated them--actuated by a reflective morality, she believed; and loathed herself for having aspired, schemed, to be a member of the class. But it was not the class, it was against her lord as representative of the class, that she was now the rebel, neither naming him nor imaging him. Her all-encompassing mind was black on him. Such as one of those hard slaughtering men could call her his own? She breathed short and breathed deep. Her bitter reason had but the common pity for a madman dispatched to his rest. Yet she knew hatred of her lord in his being suspected as instigator or accomplice of the hand that dealt the blow. He became to her thought a python whose coils were about her person, unbearable to the gaze backward. 
Moments like these are the mothers in travail of a resolve joylessly conceived, undesired to clasp, Necessity's offspring. Thunderclouds have as little love of the lightning’s they fling. 
Amanita was aware only of her torment. The trees were bending, the water hissing, the grasses all this way and that, like hands of a delirious people in surges of wreck. She scorned the meaningless shake of the garments of earth, and exclaimed: 'If we were by the sea to-night!' 
'I shall be to-morrow night,' said Salina. 'I shall think of you. Oh! Would you come with me?' 
'Would you have me?' 
'My mother will indeed be honored by your compliant to come.' 
'Write to her before the post is out.' 
'We shall travel down together?' 
Amanita nodded and smiled, and Salina kissed her hand in joy, saying, that down home she would not be so shy of calling her Amanita. She was bidden to haste.
