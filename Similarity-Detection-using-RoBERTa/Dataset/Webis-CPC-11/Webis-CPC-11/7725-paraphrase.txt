There are some things, speaking frankly, that just don't pull me in, and most drama is like that. The affair of "the glass of water", for example, simply isn't a big deal (it was boring). If I had to be involved in that sort of thing, I'd run, maybe settle in central Europe. No matter how hard I try, I can't hock my wares in this financial climate. The state of the arts here is far from state of the art and nowhere near the cutting edge -- it would take someone with a deft hand and a very, very sharp implement to divide the crud from the rest here. The whole thing is a matter of politics. Not much develops here under the current administration. We're in a lull between the time of the rebellion against authority and the time when the rebels become authorities, and there's not much we do right now other than be cautious and wait. I do plan to write something tomorrow. It's an in-depth study of the art of theater as it may come to exist sometime in the days that follow today - not tomorrow, but years, maybe centuries, after tomorrow. There is a place for it in a politics-themed publication I won't name, but I don't plan to include much along political lines. So your secrets, such as they are, are safe. I have to, though, set down my thoughts about the stage and what happens on it. I have to be passionate and fixated on my goals, to embody the virtues that our color, red, represents. It's the only wise course of action. I'm not the only one who thinks so. He who speaks for you, B., agrees. He's listened to my rants about desires for financial gains. He knows I am committed to seeing my income matches M.'s, or, preferably, exceeds that sum by a long shot. And he also knows that if I don't get what I want, I'll express myself in some frightening, if art-related, ways. In fact, that's probably what I'll do no matter what: scare people with art. Tell me you think it's a good idea. Or just help me do it, because that'd be better.
