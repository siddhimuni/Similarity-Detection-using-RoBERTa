Upon seeing Lancelot sitting there pensively, the lady of the house spoke to him: "Sir, for Heaven's sake and for your own good, tell me the truth, why have you changed? You don't eat or drink anything, and you never laugh or act happy. You can tell me what's bothering you."
"For goodness sake, don't be alarmed by my sadness! Yes, I am unhappy, since I cannot be where I wish to be - at the tournament where people will gather and make the earth tremor. Nonetheless, if it is your will and the will of God, you can be sure I will return to my captivity here."
"I will happily do it," she replied, "if it could not cost me my life. But I am terrified of the detestable Lord Meleagant, that I cannot do it, or he would kill my husband. He is very terrifying, so it is not strange that I fear him."
"Lady, if you are afraid I will not return after the tournament, I will swear to you that nothing will stop me from coming back after the tournament."
"You have my word," she said, "I will allow you to go under one condition."
"Under what condition, my Lady?"
"Upon the ocnidtion that you will swear to return to come back and promise that you will love me."
"My lady, I swear to give you all the love I have upon my return."
The lady laughs and says, "I have no reason to brag about such a gift, because I know you have already given your love to someone else. But, I will take what I can get. I will be satisfied with whatever I can have, and will take your word that you will return here as a prisoner."

Upon receiving her word, Lancelot swears that he will return to her. And the lady gives him the arms of her lord and his strong and brave stallion.
