He didn't much care for anything because he spent all day playing on a beach and he saw some girl's boobs.

There were some signs pointing to bad news.

He tried to run away from the bad news by getting on a boat to get the heck out of there.

Nine long days passed, and the ship wasn't looking too good. The aforementioned bad news was still afoot in the shape of a big storm.

The storm looked like the god Athena, and she looked pissed. The guy who ran away in the first place really liked Athena and jumped ship. No one ever spoke of the situation again.

The body washed up on shore later on.
