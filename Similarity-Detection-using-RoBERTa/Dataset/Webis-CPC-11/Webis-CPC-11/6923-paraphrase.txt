More than that, they were so fine and fit they wouldn't place a foot on the ground unless there was a carpet laid down for them to walk on.

I'm told that it was certainly was a spectacle to see those people strolling on the carpets, rustling the silk clothes that were trailing behind them, chatting and nodding to themselves, though never acknowledging the common people on the ground, never even glancing at them.

Moreover, they were so snobbish that they thought the earth itself was beneath their notice. They walked along with heads and their eyes raised high.

Rest assured their actions did not endear themselves with commoners, for people naturally do not care for being looked down upon when it is obvious that all are really equals in the end.

They continued in this manner, becoming increasingly pompous and arrogent until at last they stole the people's attention from God, who must have been thinking "Who are these arrogent people, strutting about and spurning my earth with carpets? Who are these people who treat my creation as if it were dirt beneath their feet, who despise their brethren for being common, with eyes raised as if to disdain to look upon that which I made?

I must punish these presumptuous people and teach them that all of My creation is equal in My sight."

So the Lord God passed judgement on the moles. First He took away their human shape and He shrank them to their current size to indicate their worth in His sight. Then, because they thought themselves too good to walk upon the bare ground, He sent them to live underneath it, where that were forced to claw and dig their way.
