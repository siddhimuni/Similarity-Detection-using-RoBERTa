Delinquents by nature, such as are to be found in most of our
large cities; people born with savage instincts; men who would rather pass their days in the
midst of vice and open corruption than live a life of honour and opulence.

None of these delinquents are to be found in thorough-bred Sakai tribes, they may however be
met with amongst the inhabitants of the plain where there is a mixture of race, the result
of those forced unions which were the desperation of Sakai women when taken prisoners. In the
children born of these unions one can often trace the natural impulse towards violence and
robbery that they have inherited from their fathers.

I myself had a proof of this.

As Inspector I often used to pass from one encampment to another, sometimes on the plain and
sometimes on the mountain and I frequently took these brief journeys alone as the paths were
well trodden.

It so happened that one day I had stopped in the hut of one of these half-breeds--where there
were several real Sakais who had come from their jungle home to exchange products--and on my
return I was overtaken by one of my good friends that offered to accompany me for a little way.

As we walked along together I noticed he proceeded with great caution and kept looking about
with suspicion. All at once he caught me by the arm and pointed to a stick stuck into the ground
just in front, from which some leaves were dangling. As I did not understand his act he advanced
a step or two and showed me a well concealed trap, set with a poisoned dart.
