In east and west alike. It is so in rome and in gaul (by the testimony of irenaeus). It is in greece (by the testimony of aristides). It is in africa (by the testimony of tertullian); in alexandria (by the testimony of clement and origen); in asia (by the testimony of justin martyr, irenaeus, and ignatius); in palestine and syria (by the testimony of ignatius and justin martyr). Irenaeus, if any one, should know what the apostles taught, for before he came to rome he had been the pupil of polycarp in asia, who had himself sat at the feet of st. John. "everything that we know," says mr. Rendel harris, "of the dogmatics of the early part of the second century agrees with the belief that at that period the virginity of mary was a part of the formulated christian belief."* how could the belief in the virgin-birth have taken such undisputed possession of so many widely separated and independent churches unless it had had apostolic authority?+ what other explanation can be given for the fact? There is as complete a consensus of tradition as could reasonably be asked for. It is impossible to imagine that the doctrine of the virgin-birth can have been suddenly evolved in the early years of the second century. The only adequate explanation is that it was a substantial part of the apostolic tradition. It may be worth while here to quote the words of so distinguished a scholar as professor zahn, of erlangen. "this [the virgin-birth] has been an element of the creed as far as we can trace it back; and if ignatius can be taken as a witness of a baptismal creed springing from early apostolic times, certainly in that creed the name of the virgin mary already had its place .... We may further assert that during the first four centuries of the church, no teacher and no religious community which can be considered with any appearance of right as an heir of original christianity, had any other notion of the beginning of the [human] life of jesus of nazareth .... The theory of an original christianity without the belief in jesus the son of god, born of the virgin, is a fiction."#
