She is shown how to make it as she hears the sound.
At right moment her fatger leaves home,Lines writes
to him,receives and is able to read his answer,printed her own in Romantic capitals.She has learned and the reading is accomplished as he sends her a picture book and she is helped to see how letters resemble those.

In England Miss Dale's phonic method is best known probably.It is very ingenious,the analysisis thorough and the books are really got up,but those who feel that reading,though a most  valuable tool,
but the tool is not for children under seven years,
the method seems over-elaborate.Much depends on the 
teacher but to see fifty children sitting still while one child places the letters in their places on the board suggests a great deal of lost time.The system is also so rigidly phonic that it is a long time before a child can pick up a ordinary book with any profit.

stanley Hall holds that it is best to cobine the methods,and most of us do this."The growing agreement"is,he says,"that there is no one and only orthodox way of teaching and learning is greatest and hardest of all the arts,in which many important parts of our body must train the others to automatic
perfection,in ways hard and easy,by devices old and latest,mechanically and consciously,actively and passively...this is a great gain and seems now secure.while a good pedagogic method is one of the most economic--both of labour and of money--of all inventions,the brightest children should be never neglected,and indeed most children,if taught at home or individually,very few methods of refinements are needed.Idiots,as Mr.Seguin first showed,need and profit greatly by very extended methods in learning how to walk,feed and dress themselves,which would only retard a normal child.
Above all it get idea in mind that the stated use of any method does not preclude the incidental use of any and perhaps of all others."

education by Life were we can find adaptation of phonic combined with the word method.Being combined with word method ,it is simpler than miss Dale's,children get much more quickly to real stories.Stanley Hall advocates the individual teaching of reading,and have found that once the children know some sounds,in individual learning there is great advantage,but class teachin has its own advantages also it seems bestto have a combination.Long since we taught a boy who was mentally deficient and incapable of intelligent analysis,by all the words with corresponding pictures.Miss payne has developed to great extent.In solving puzzles it is practically an appeal.The children choose  their own pictures and
are supplied with envelopes containing either single sounds,or whole words corresponding with the picture.They lay h on the house,g on the girl,p on the pond,and later do the same with words.They certainly enjoy it,and no one is ever been waiting.sometimes the puzzle is to set in order the
words of a nursery rhyme which they already know,
sometimes it is to read and draw everything required.
