Careful letters are retained of the motor operation; the gas consumption and the pack on the motor are noticed and listed every twenty min.; the quantity of jacket water accustomed on the gas motor, and also its temperature entering and retiring the motor jackets, are listed every hour. Indicator cards are removed every two hours. The labor is continuous, and each day is separated into three motions of eight hours each; the duration of a trial, however, is ambitious very largely via the personality and behavior of the fuel used. 

A draft research of the comparative efficiency of the coals found in unlike shares of the United States, as producers of illuminating gas, has been almost ended beneath the instruction of Mr. Alfred H. White, and a newspaper setting forth the results is in press.[23] 

Tests of Liquid Fuels.--Tests of liquid fuels in internal-combustion motors, in commission of Mr. R. M. Strong, are waged in the engine-room of Building No. 13. 

The various liquid hydro-carbon fuels accustomed in internal-combustion motors for making energy, range from the lamp refined oils, such as naphtha, to the crude petroleums, and have a correspondingly wide variation of physical and chemical properties. 

The majority alright of the liquid fuels for exert in internal-combustion motors, are alcohol and the lamp refined hydro-carbon oils, such as gasoline. These fuels, however, are the majority expensive in commercial exert, even as shortly as devoured with the highest practical efficiency, which, it is thought, has already been averaged, as far as current breeds of motors are concerned. 

At current small is known as to how far a lot of the very inexpensive distillates and crude petroleums can be accustomed as fuel for internal-combustion engines. It is difficult to exert them at all, despite efficiency. 

Gasoline is comparatively constant in quality, and can be accustomed with identical efficiency in any petrol motor of the superior grade.
