Social interaction as well as ladies and gentlemen, this book is particularly bad. It seems that the author was unaware of the usages of good society, and impatient, vulgar ceremony worse than people had seen no way to defend the superiority of his two fair ladies and imagine your friends, except that they dispense altogether with such feelings, regardless. His uncertainty about how people really act in their position has been hampered by his powers, and he does not have that rarity, the original author, but a very common person, who tries to be original. Real ladies and gentlemen will not be reduced as an alternative to either be embarrassed or normal social rules than the totally, they take advantage of them. It is a false originality is unique about the ordinary, it's just a beginner in chess, which is"original"his first step, Paul Morphy, most inventive players, begin the habit before the king  n soldier.

We can not close our notice of this book without praise for the old French fencing champion particularly good. He speaks very simply and very issues that he understands, and is silent on who she does not understand - both in relation to providing an excellent example of the important characters.
