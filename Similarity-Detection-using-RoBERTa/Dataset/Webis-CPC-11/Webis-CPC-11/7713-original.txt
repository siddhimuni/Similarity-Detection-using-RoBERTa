Space ought to be added to that list."

"Did you notice something else about that letter?" Alhamid asked. "I mean, the very fact that
he wrote a letter instead of telling you personally?"

"Sure. He didn't trust me. He was afraid I, or someone else, would dispose of him if we knew
he knew our secret."

"I think that's it," Alhamid agreed. "He wanted to be safely away first."

"Killing him would have brought down the biggest investigation the Earth Congress has launched
since the crack-up of the Earth-Luna ship thirty years ago. Does he think we are fools?"

"You can't blame him. He's been brought up that way, and three months of training isn't going
to change him."

St. Simon frowned. "Suppose he changes his mind? Suppose he tells Tarnhorst what he thinks?"

"He won't. He's told his lie, and now he'll have to stick by it or lose his precious security.
If he couldn't trade that for freedom, he sure isn't going to throw it away." Alhamid grinned.
"But can you imagine a guy thinking that anchor setting could be completely mechanized?"

St. Simon grinned back. "I guess I'm not a very good teacher after all. I told him and told
him and told him for three solid months that the job required judgment, but it evidently didn't
sink in. He's got the heart of a romantic and the soul of an Earthman--a very bad combination."

"He has my sympathy," Alhamid said with feeling. "Now, about you. Your blue ticket still has
three months to run, but I can't give you a class if you're only going to run through the first
half of the course with them, and I don't have any more Earthmen for you to give special tutoring
to. You have three choices: You can loaf with pay for three months; you can go back to space
and get double pay for three months; or you can take a regular six-month class and get double
pay for the last three months.
