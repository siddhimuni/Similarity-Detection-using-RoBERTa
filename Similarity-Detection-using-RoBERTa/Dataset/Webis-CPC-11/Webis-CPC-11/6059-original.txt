He took part in
the attack upon Navarin under Orlóff, and died after a long and distinguished career of service,
having founded, in his new country, the family of Annibáloff, of which Púshkin was the most
distinguished ornament, and of whose African origin the poet, both in personal appearance and
in mental physiognomy, bore the most unequivocal marks. To the memory of this singular progenitor,
Púshkin has consecrated more than one of his smaller works, and has frequently alluded to the
African blood which he inherited from the admiral.

In 1811, Púshkin obtained (through the interest of Turgénieff, to whom Russia is thus, in some
sort, indebted for her great poet) admission into the Imperial Lyceum of Tsárskoë Seló, where
he was to receive the education, and to form the friendships, which so strongly coloured, not
only the literary productions of his whole career, but undoubtedly modified, to a considerable
extent, the personal character of the poet. This institution, then recently established by
the Emperor Alexander, and always honoured by the peculiar favour and protection of its illustrious
founder, was modelled on the plan of those lycées which France owed to the genius of Napoleon;
and was intended to confer upon its pupils the advantage of a complete encyclopedic education,
and, not only embracing the preparatory or school course, but also the academic curriculum
of a university, was calculated to dismiss the students, at the end of their course of training,
immediately into active life. The Lyceum must be undoubtedly considered as having nursed in
its bosom a greater number of distinguished men than any other educational institution in the
country; and our readers may judge of the peculiar privileges enjoyed by this establishment,
(the primary object of whose foundation was, that of furnishing to the higher civil departments
in the government, and to the ministry of foreign affairs in particular, a supply of able and
accomplished employés,) from the fact of its having been located by the emperor in a wing of
the palace of Tsárskoë Seló--the favourite summer residence of the Tsars of Russia since the
time of Catharine II. It is to the last-named sovereign, as is well known to travellers, that
this celebrated spot is indebted for its splendid palace and magnificent gardens, forming,
perhaps, the most striking object which gratifies the stranger's curiosity in the environs
of St Petersburg.

The students of the Lyceum are almost always youths of the most distinguished families among
the Russian nobility, and are themselves selected from among the most promising in point of
intellect. The system of education pursued within its walls is of the most complete nature,
partaking, as may be concluded from what we have said, of both a scientific and literary character;
and a single glance at a list of the first course (of which Púshkin was a member) will suffice
to show, that it counted, among its numbers, many names destined to high distinction.
