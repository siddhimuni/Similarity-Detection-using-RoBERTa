The note in dispute was heard with equal distinctness by Homer and Wordsworth; and indeed there are few poets of any age or country who have not, at one time or other in their lives, had the testimony of their own ears as to its character. Whence, then, this difference of opinion?
We might go on much longer in this strain.

We might give, likewise, the mythological cause assigned for the imputed melancholy, and add that some, not content with this, represent the bird as leaning its breast against a thorn--

'To aggravate the inward grief, Which makes its music so forlorn.'

But we would rather pause to admit candidly, that two of the above witnesses might be challenged--Virgil and Thomson; who indeed should be counted but as one, for the author of the Seasons, in the lines quoted, has translated, though not so closely as Dryden, from the Georgics of the Latin poet.

If you will read the passage-it matters not whether in Virgil, Dryden, or Thomson-you will perceive that it is a special occurrence that is spoken of: no statement whatever is made as to the character of the nightingale's ordinary song. Thomson, in the course of his humane and touching protest against the barbarous art: 'through which birds are

-by tyrant man Inhuman caught, and in the narrow cage From liberty confined, and boundless air,'

represents the nightingale's misery when thus bereaved.

This portion of the lines shall stand entire; none, we are sure, would wish us further to mangle the passage:

'But chief, let not the nightingale lament Her ruined care, too delicately framed To brook the harsh confinement of the cage.

Oft, when returning with her loaded bill, The astonished mother finds a vacant nest, By the rude hands of unrelenting clowns Robbed: to the ground the vain provision falls.
