A popular British author of our own day, in order to demonstrate the law of compensation, as
regards the literary vocation, cites its inexpensiveness,--arguing, that, whereas the artist
must invest capital, however small, in colors, marble, canvas, and studio-hire, and the professional
man occupy a costly locality, the author needs but a quire of foolscap and a pen and ink to
set up in trade. While there is literal truth in this comparison, the fact is not applicable
to historical writing, except in a very limited degree. The preparation of the most successful
works in this department, in modern times, has been attended with an outlay impossible to the
poor scholar. It has involved the examination and reproduction of voluminous manuscript authorities,
distant travel, the purchase of rare books and family papers, and sometimes years of busy reference,
observation, and study, lucrative only in prospect. The same amount of culture and facile vigor
of composition which less prosperous authors expend on a masterly review would suffice to make
them famous historians, if blessed with the pecuniary means to seek foreign sources of information,
or gather about them scattered and rare materials wherewith to weave a chronicle of the past.
Hence, not only has History become the chosen field of writers with no special gift for more
individually inspired kinds of literature, but of the educated sons of fortune. Accordingly,
it is curious to remark the contrast between the lives of historians and those of poets; and
in the average circumstances of the former there is some justification for the title of an
aristocratic guild in letters. Compare Cowper's humble home at Olney with Gibbon's elegant
library at Lausanne,--the social environment of Hallam, Grote, or Macaulay with the rustic
isolation of Wordsworth, the economies of Shelley, or the life-struggle of Jerrold.
