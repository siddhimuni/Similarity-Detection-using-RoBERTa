It was evidentially proved that the remedies which worked for the cholera morbus, were injurious in the same disease in Russia.  Brandy with laudanum was prescribed as a preventive measure against the contagion, wherein the former boosts the vigour of abdominal viscera and the latter to prevent excitability of the system.  In India these worked out well, in cases of cholera.  We suggest those who believe in the prophecy of our correspondent, which appears to be real, to have a good stock of brandy and laudanum.  Though bleeding was noticed, the cases seemed to depend on the natural stamina of the patients, even when calomel in varying doses, opium, careput oil, subcarbonate of ammonia, muriatic acid, camphor fumigation, warm covering and friction have been employed the disease has followed its regular course.  It as terminated fatally to those who had freely used wine and spirits.  The Russians who took fish-oil at every meal it has proved relatively fatal than among the Poles.

Dr. Reece's Gazette of Practical Medicine is quoted here

Mr. Hope an eminent surgeon, who has had thirty years of experience, is found in the Atlas, wherein cases of cholera morbus were treated successfully and had revealed the means which he used for the public benefit. He said the remedy used was one drachm of nitrous acid, one ounce of peppermint-water or camphor mixture, and 40 drops of tincture of opium, one quarter every three or four hours in a cupful of thin gruel.  The stomach should be covered with hot clothes, feet by bottled hot water; constant intake clear gruel, or sago or tapioca; no use of spirit, wine or fermented liquors till recovery.  Laudanum is now used by French surgeons who abstain from venesection.  Simply repeated use of hot water in large quantities can also be tried.

A report as a reply to the  Medical Gazette is as follows:- 

From the latest news from St. Petersburgh we came to know that one of the most famous and intelligent of the physicians of Russia has been appointed in tracing the spread of cholera, and the conclusion is that the disease is spread by contagion exclusively and not because of the atmosphereical influence.  It appeared at Corason, the residence of Abbas Mirza in Persia, in 1830 during the spring, where several of the Russian mission too died, and Prince Dolgonrowky, the minister, was also severely affected but narrowly escaped death.  It broke out in the Russian province of Schirvan and Bacon in July; then it spread ot Tifflis by land and to Astracan from the port of Bacon by sea.  It was around the same time about July 20th.  Precautions were not taken and it permeated Georgia, following the primary course of roads and it spread only when someone from the infected towns visited other places.  

A Moravian village was lucky to escape which was in the line of the road. People from Bacon, ran along  the Volga because of the warnings, but carried the disease with them.  it appeared once again at Jondayersk o the 22nd of July, at Krasnoyar on the 25th; at Tzarilzin on the 6th of August; Donbooka and Saratoff on the 7th; at Khvalnisk on the 19th; Novogorod on the 27th; Koshoma on the 3rd of September; Yaroslaff 6th; and at Rybinsk on the 10th.  Navigators of the Volga were the first people to get infected or others who arrived from placed already affected.
