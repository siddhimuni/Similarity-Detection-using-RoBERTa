Married quarters for some of the non-commissioned officers
are provided, but not for privates. American barracks are interesting, as providing for perhaps
a higher class of recruit than usual; they are well designed and superior finish internally
is given. The barracks are arranged usually on the separate block system, and centre round
a post-exchange or soldiers' club, which is a combined recreation establishment, gymnasium
and sergeants' mess, with bath-house attached. Canteens for the sale of liquor were abolished
in 1901.

BARRANDE, JOACHIM (1799-1883), Austrian geologist and palaeontologist, was born at Saugues,
Haute Loire, on the 11th of August 1799, and educated in the Ã‰cole Polytechnique at Paris.
Although he had received the training of an engineer, his first appointment was that of tutor
to the duc de Bordeaux (afterwards known as the comte de Chambord), grandson of Charles X.,
and when the king abdicated in 1830, Barrande accompanied the royal exiles to England and Scotland,
and afterwards to Prague. Settling in that city in 1831, he became occupied in engineering
works, and his attention was then attracted to the fossils from the Lower Palaeozoic rocks
of Bohemia. The publication in 1839 of Murchison's Silurian System incited Barrande to carry
on systematic researches on the equivalent strata in Bohemia.
