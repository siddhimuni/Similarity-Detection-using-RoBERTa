It appears that the African-Americans have round skulls, a slanted forehead, wide jaws, protruding lips, a wide nose, kinky hair, inappropriately mentioned as wool, extended arms, stout thighs, thin legs, tall heels, and flat feet. All of these characteristics varied by tribe. The skin colors vary...from dark, deep black to the light color of the mulattoes. Some are more bronze colored. In many tribes, the jaws do not protrude as much, and the lips do not appear as large. Noses can also vary from the wide ones to more angled, slanted or crooked. Some even mention Grecian profiles as a similarity.

Paul Broca stated that the arms of the African American are shorter and lower, which makes them less like the apes...contrary to the Europeans.  The African American's femur has simmilar measurements of the ape, however, he has a shorter humerus, moreso than the Europeans. The skulls are also thin. The most common characteristic is the darkness or lightness of skin. The colors vary from light, bronze, olive, or deep brown, then blackest black. The shading are deeper than those of Southern Erupose. Hair is short, and goes across rather than up an ddown. South African tribes, like the Kaffirs and Betshuans, have hair put into plaits. It is not the same as the Hottentots. Their hair is typically black and turns gray as they age. There are cases of them with reddish hair, brows, and lashes...mostly among the Monbuttoo. Some even have been found with ashy pale hair. There is also hair on the body, but not excessive. 

African Americans are primarily Southern and in Central Africa. The Bantu should not have been separated into their own race. However, South Africans can be categorized from the Soudans.
