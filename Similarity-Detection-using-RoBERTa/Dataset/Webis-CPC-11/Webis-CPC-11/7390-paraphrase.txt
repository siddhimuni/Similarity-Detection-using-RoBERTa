In addition to noble and splendid sacrifices, such as those make by kings, there are also more simple types of sacrifice. For example, sacrifices made by Saul (1Samuel xiv.35) and Elisha (1Kings xix.2I). Both of these types of sacrifices are only acceptable if they are dedicated to the proper god. Unless we ignore the Book of Kings, which would mean that cults outside of Jerusalem are heretical,  nowhere is it written that a sacrifice, which was dedicated to the God of Israel, could be illegitimate. For example, Naaman, in 2Kings 5:17, follows his native Syrian ritual, but this does not seem to devalue the acceptability of his offering. It is very rare that these sacrificial rituals are described in detail. When they are, however, it is impossible to reconcile them with the letter of the law. A shocking example of this is when Gideon uses a procedure that is still generally used at Ophrah. Gideon takes a he-going, boils it, bakes in the ashes of unleavened bread, puts the bread and meat into a basket, puts the soup into a pot, and then the meal is burnt in the flame of the altar. Certainly, there were sacrifices that fell more into the letter of the Pentateuch law, but the point to note is that the line between acceptable and heretical sacrifices is quite blurred.
