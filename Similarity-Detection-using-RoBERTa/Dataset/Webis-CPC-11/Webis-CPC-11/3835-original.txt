This was not, however, its earliest appearance, as it
is found in a quarto one bearing date 1707, printed by the Queen's printers, Charles Bill and
the Executrix of Thomas Newcomb. It occurs immediately before the Articles, and is simply entitled,
"At the healing."

N.E.R. (a Subscriber.)

    [Prayers at the Healing may be found in Sparrow's Collection of
    Articles, Injunctions, Canons, &c., p. 223. 4to. 1661. The Loyal Dales Volunteers were
surnamed "The Haver-cake Lads." Previously to seeing the Note of G.M., I
imagined the "aver" to be derived from "avena" (Lat.), "avoine" (Fr.). What
dictionary defines "aver" (French) as denoting the annual stock or
produce of a farm?

D.2.

E.M., in his Note on J. MN.'s remarks on hogs, mentions that the term aver, averium, is still
used in Guernsey. Is not this word closely connected with the Eber of the German JÃ¤gers?

Pilgarlic (Vol. ii., p. 393.).--Sir John Denham spelt this word Peel-garlick--it may be found
in one of his Directions to a Painter--but the passage in which it appears is scarcely fit
for quotation. The George of the couplet referred to was Albemarle, who had been wounded during
the fight in the part of his person which Hudibras alludes to when he tells us that one wound there

                  "hurts honour more
  Than twenty wounds laid on before."

Denham seems to compare Albemarle's wounded buttocks to a peeled onion! The resemblance (to
Denham) would account for his use of the word in this instance; but it is pretty evident that
the word was not coined by him.
