They are first placed in a large saucepan and cover with boiling water. This loosens the skin, which is easily removed, and the tomatoes are reinstated to the preservation of the boiler, set over a medium heat without the addition of water, or seasoning, and heated to boiling. After boil slowly half an hour, they are put into the jars in boiling hot and tightly closed. Be kept two or three years in this way. The bottles should be filled to the rim to prevent air from entering the, and placed in a cool, dark cupboard.

A CAN corn.

Divide the beans lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the back blade, leaving the hulls on the cob. Fill cans cut corn, pressing very hard. Press for corn in the can, use the small end of a potato masher, as it may enter the facility. It will take ten to a dozen large ears of corn to fill a can of a room. When the cans are full, screw the lid with your thumb and index finger, which should be sufficiently tight, then place a tarp at the bottom of a wash boiler to prevent breakage. On this put a layer of cans in the position you prefer, in the cans to put a layer of fabric, then a layer of cans. Fill the boiler in this way, then cover the cans with cold water, put the kettle on the fire and boil three hours without ceasing. In constant boiling depends heavily on your success. After three hours of boiling, lift the boiler from heat, cool water, then take the cans and push the boiler, let stand until cool, then tighten again. Wrap each one can be in brown paper to exclude light and keep in a cool basement, dry and be very sure no rubber rings are hardened by use. The rings must be renewed every two years. I would advise beginners to use new rings of all, poor rings cause the loss of preserved fruits and vegetables in many cases. You'll note that in the cans canned corn are not wrapped in a cloth, or heat, just full of corn cut.
