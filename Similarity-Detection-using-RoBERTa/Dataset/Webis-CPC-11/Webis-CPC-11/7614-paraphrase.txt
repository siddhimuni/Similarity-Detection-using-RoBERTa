RITA (from inside): What is wrong?  What is going on?

BERTHA (speaking from the doorway):  The man over here really wants to come see you.  He is on his way through here.

RITA (inside; chuckles): Invite him to come inside.

(Bertha leaves.)

(Friedrich stood at the middle door.)

RITA: Hello?  How is there?  Friedrich -- I will be right there.

BERTHA (walks outside and stares at Friedrich in shock): My boss wants you to wait for her here.  (She looks at Friedrich one more time and then leaves.)

(Friedrich looked around in shy embarassment.)
