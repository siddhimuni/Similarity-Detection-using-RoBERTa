This stated idea was meant to be shown by the word Most-High applied to the Syrian gods called Baals as well as to Jehovah. According to this heavenas-based cult, the "Most High" resided in the giant globe that held the spheres of all the stars and hugged the entire galaxy that he ruled. The Romanic peoples translated the name of this to show that this God was the highest. 

This god's power was said to cover the expanse of all eternity. A singular tenant of all pre-Babylonian astronomy was that all comic phenomena was caused or determined by the movements of heavenly bodies and so thereby, sidereal influence. The changes of Mother Nature, as well as the minds of humanity, were controlled as led by "Destiny" and, by the cosmic energies that lived in the dimensional sky. As restating, the gods were invincible; they were the holders of the reins of the universe. The Baals religion was based upon the idea that this autocracy had yet held. As we have stated, they were conceived after the image of an Asiatic monarch, and the religious terminology was evidently intended to display the humility of their priests toward them. In Syria we find nothing analogous to what existed in Egypt, where the priest thought he could compel the gods to act, and even dared to threaten them. There was yet said to be a great expanse between these "gods" and he common mortal, astrology only emphasized this by making them seem overpowering and almighty. In the Latin world the Asian religious systems provoked and diffused these ideas over all the planet Earth. Apuleius calls the Syrian goddess, "Mother Nature."

The watching of heavely bodies had, moreover, led theses astrologers to the arguable fact of a eternity within which a person could be in the hands of God after death . The constant turning and revolving upon axes of plants and other heavenly bodies was only to set their minds upon this thouroughly.
