He was very curious as to the reason that I had come so far, and questioned me intensely as to the specific reason for my visit. It was beyond him that I would make the trip so far across the country side, that I would spend two long days traveling just to see him briefly, and have no information to impart?
"Do you not even have a letter from someone at home for me? What induced you to come?
I did have no letter, and I desired that no one knew I made this trip. Everyone at home would think that I, Reine, would be so foolish to visit such a famous person. I really desired that they would never find out. I trued in vain to explain my reasoning to him. 
"An idea came over me, and I tried to push it away, but not matter how I tried, I could not. I could barely even sleep. I had to act. I shut up my shop on Saturday night as normal and planned to come to Marseille to visit you right away. That way, I could be back at work Monday with none being the wiser, and I could handle the business that I needed to."
He questioned why I needed to see him, and even how I knew where to find him.
In response I told him, "I make dresses for the daughters of a man who has been very nice to me, and I was previously a servant to his mother. Where I am from, nobles treat peasants very kindly. THe kind man knows how much I love to read, even though I am not in a situation to afford newspapers or books, so he would sometimes let me borrow books from his family, in particular book that they knew would interest me, like interesting stories by my favorite writers, fashionable engravings and drawings and things pertaining to the history of your life sir. I love poetry sir, and you are the most poetic person I have ever encountered."
