At the end of the conference, Mr. Grenville took my hand and squeezed again. He kissed the ladies and withdrew. He kissed the maid in the kitchen as he seemed to be a kind hearted gentleman. He is young and gentle and handsome. He has a pair of kind and piercing eyes but he also carry a monocle chained and suspended from his buttonhole. The boys are hollering and dogs are barking somewhere out there and cats are scampering about. He withdrew out of the house.
We told stories of adventures among ourselves and made the night merry and soon after settled into quiet night not to be interrupted any more. I am glad I have no interest in the matter for which he sued. If I had I had to refuse him since he is on the side of Crown over dispute between Crown and Commons. It is comforting to know you in a position of no consequence in the world where you can not offend or disoblige someone. The town seems to be on his side and if he is equally liked all around the country he is sure to be elected.
Mr. Ashburner may have been a little mortified to see him visit me to his misplaced importance to my position in this matter. But had he thought to inform Mr. Grenville of my pandering to multiple parties, I would have been bound to respond one way or another.

Now rekindle the fire and pull the shutters quick. Let curtains fall and move the sofa around. While hissing and bubbling urn steams up a column of steam and let the cups that make us drunk but not yet. They are cheerful to our eyes. So, let us welcome this evening in peace.

COWPER.--The Winter Evening.
XXVII. FROM "THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL."[G]
RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.--1751-1816.
SCENE.--A Room in SIR PETER TEAZLE'S House.
Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE.

Sir Pet. What an old bachelor supposed to do when he marries a young wife? What is he to expect? It has been six months since Lady Teazle married me and made me the happiest man.
I have been the wet dog, most miserable of them all, ever since.
