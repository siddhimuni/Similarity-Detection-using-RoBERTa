Most of the book is filled with a series of letters from one of these prisoners to their mother. Perhaps (suspected) the author of these was not quite a normal young man. For whatever reason, it is certain that his letters are far uncheery reading, his books and study, most of all her friends (with a fellow prisoner, especially), seem to have kept him happy and content, even. Of course, any part of this may well have been colored by the mother's eyes, is clearly deeply concerned that should not be too worried about him. A more impartial Ruhleben conditions given in the second half of the volume, and a letter from Sir Timothy Eden, reproduced in The Times, in the case of a greater exchange of civilian prisoners. 
I should add that the book is illustrated with a series of drawings of Ruhleben Mr. Stanley Grimm, an artist of the Expressionist school (whatever that is). These are vigorous and detention if, in view unmodern, something formless. But they are part of a record that every Englishman can be studied with accelerated sympathy and great pride in the value and resources of our race as unnecessarily brutal conditions at their worst and never better than just bearable.

Nothing will convince me that this output (Methuen) is an attractive title for a novel, however efficient it may get a notice in a train station. The book itself, however, it is interesting despite its sadness. The grandfather of Jane and John-Andrew roam over a murder in cold blood - this in the foreword. Then, when we get to the real story, we meet Jane playing the popular fiction at an amazing rate, and his brother, John Andrew, who live in the same product.
