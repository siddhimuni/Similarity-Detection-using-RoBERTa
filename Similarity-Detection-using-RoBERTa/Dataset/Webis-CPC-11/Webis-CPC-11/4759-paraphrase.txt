There are so many beliefs that still scares us out, but there is only one belief that we can not argue with, it is the faith for our God. The lost faith sometimes get to us fear and distraction and false beliefs. There was a poor and wounded Protestant that came to a Catholic priest, for there is a belief that they can perform exorcism or pulling out devil spirits outside a human body. The man was said possesed by a devil, when this man got to a quack doctor-as another belief, he got this possesed thing. After giving him charms and some weird facts and rituals, he was betrayed by the quack doctor by selling the poor man's sou to the devil. Then the poor man experienced torments and horror. He forgets what he really needs to take away his burdens and fear, he has losts his faith and getting help from an unpopular fake healer. Then the priest advise this man what is the best thing to do, get his lost faith and find a good physician that will help him recover what's lost. Getting back on his faith, building quiet time thru prayers, Bible reading and worshipping God. These are the real beliefs he has forgotten and almost killed his faith.
