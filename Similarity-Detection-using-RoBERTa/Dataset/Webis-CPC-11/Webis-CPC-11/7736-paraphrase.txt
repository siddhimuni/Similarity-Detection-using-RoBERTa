Lewis Theobald's version of Shakesphere (1734) is one of the starting points for learning modern Shakesphere, and from there, litery education in general. It is the first time a English writers with professional knowlege of Shakesphere's time period tries to bring in facts and ideas relevent to the current time period from Shakesphere's text, as well as explaining his oddities. Thebold was the first editor that seemed to understand Shakesphere's older and difficult language, as well as his poetic methods, as well as the methods used by his fellow writers, where his plays came from, the order they were written it, and the use of drama to make the plays come alive. For this, in the edition and the introduction, Theobald stands out as an important ancestor in modern English studies.

It's quite unforunate that this man would be looked down on and insulted by the Pope. The Pope wrote a book about Shakesphere in 1725, and Theobold made the Pope his enemy but write a book that pointed out two hundred mistakes in the Pope's work. It was more then a conflict between two writers, but a clash of styles. The Pope's writing was that of being polite while Theobold was the first to persue the path of actual critism, calling himself a "literal critic". The concept of being a critic was owed to that Richard Bentley. Theobold's oponents had their own nickname for him, calling him the "Word-catcher."

His work was his first his project and demonstration of "literal criticism." At first Theobold had meant to write further commentary on Shakesphere's plays, but then he decided to write a book. From the start, Theobold found a lot of support for his book from people interested in books. With the aid of subscribers--including the royal family--his work moved forward, and the book was completed in 1731. However, due to publishing delays, the book was not printed until 1734. However, when it was published, it was clear to all, even his critics and the Pope, that his method worked.
