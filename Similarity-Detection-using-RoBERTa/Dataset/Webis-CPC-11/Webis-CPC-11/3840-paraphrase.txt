To physical sufferings during two winters was added the disgruntled effects of losing a friend to whom he was very attached; he died in the spring of 1942 under the difficulty of the war. The Ã‰loge in which Vauvenargues honors the virtues and the sad outcome of his friend, is too deeply stained with the florid and bombastic style of manhood to be pleasing to a more prepared feel.[5] He cried that nobody who had read it saw that it was touching, not recollecting that even the most soft emotion is unable to to touch us, when it has found artificial and declamatory expression. Frailty and heat of love were present traits in Vauvenargues.

 maybe if his life had been passed in less hard wrought turns of events, this fine vulnerability might have kindness and a level headed mind, in which there was never the faintest tinge of uncertainty, caprice, exacting self love, or any of those other weaknesses which confide in men that great awareness of their own character, which sits at the base of most of the impediments in the way of an even and decent life. His nature had such detail and positive characteristics that the infinite untowardness of outcomings left no hard heartedness upon him; hardship made him not bitter, but constitute and capable, and there is no better sign of mature temper.

The atrocities and tragedies of war were not his only battles. Vauvenargues was beset throughout the entirety of his short lived life with the cleanliness and humbling embarrassments of restricted means. His letters to Saint-Vincens, the most devoted of his friends, open the straits to which he was driven. The nature of these straits is an old story all over the world, and Vauvenargues did the same things that young men in want of finances have normally done. It can't be spoken, I say, that he went along those slimy ways without some corruption. He considers him on one event that a wealthy neighbour has daughters.
