THE PASTORAL MOUNTAINS.in Professor Knight's Life of Wordsworth are found piece of which the poet intended for Michael and which were recovered from Dorothy Wordsworth's manuscript book. Among these are the following lines, which as Professor Dowden 
are given as Wordsworth's answer to the question, "What feeling for external nature had such a man as Michael?" The lines, which correspond to lines 62-77 of the poem, are as follows;

Of his own business and the goings on Of earth and sky, then truly had you seen That in his thoughts there were obscurities, Wonder and admiration, things that wrought Not less than a religion of his heart."
