This comedy stars a leading man who's supposed to be a "wild-headed gentleman" who's shown to be a rascal.  The same thing is true of an awful ruffian who played a part like this 36 years prior in a play finally verified to be written by Heywood after a hunch led to strong research by Mr. Fleay.  There are similar passages in each that suggest but don't completely prove common authorship, but it's the two awful men who play the leads in each offer better evidence.

There's also the misuse of foreign words that get confused with indecent native words for some schoolboy humor that Mr. Heywood seems famous for, and it might be said that his are raunchier and funnier than those of Shakespeare.  There's another member of the trio, Mr. Dekker, who could also be accused of rude language, and no one would judge him to be less than draconic.

However, he was almost as unable as Shakespeare was to present the most abhorrent killer as anything but a bumbling sinner, who could still be taken back by the long-suffering wife that he tried to poison over and over again in a most hideous way.
