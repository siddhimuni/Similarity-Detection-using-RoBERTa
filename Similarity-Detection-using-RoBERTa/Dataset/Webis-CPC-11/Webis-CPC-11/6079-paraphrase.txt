The number of fish was already quickly shrinking due to the use of dams to close small streams, and nets to catch the fish. Not until this century did the industrious activitiy of our nation begin to take hold of the water power in the larger rivers; or to interrupt in them with tall dams. This prevented the salmon from reaching their mating grounds. The drastic effects on the food suply were bad to say the least as it already couldn't keep up with our population. 

In 1865 the salmon fisheries shut down in most the rivers known to have been originally been inhabited by them. The salmon had already been fished out of many of these rivers, and in others health salmon were extremely rare. Expired rivers included; the Androscoggin, 220 miles long; The Connecticut, 380 miles long; the Saco,120 miles long; the Merrimack,180 miles long; and twenty some smaller rivers. Salmon fiheries still survived in the Penobscot, the Kennebec, the Denny's, the East Machias, the Saint Croix, and the Aroostook. The best of these was the Penobscot, catching 5,000 to 10,000 salmon annually. The Kennebec sometimes caught 1,200 in a year, but not often. The other rivers were even still yet less productive. 

I appologize, you don't have to pay me for this. I have my final exams monday morn. and I need to get some sleep. I underestimated how much time this would take. Again I'm really sorry.
