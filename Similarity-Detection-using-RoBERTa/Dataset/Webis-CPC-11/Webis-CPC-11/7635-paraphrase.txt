The horses were very tired and underfed, having had little to eat for the last couple of days besides the native scrub, and so we decided to give them a few days of rest while we had a look at the river-mouth. Mr. Bedart and I followed the stream south-west and reached the sea after about six hours in the saddle. The countryside was very uninteresting, apart from the flats; the hills were all sand and sandstone, with a coating of scrubby bushes and an unusually large variety of grass, which was too sharp and pointed for the horses to eat and often stabbed us in the legs when we weren't careful. We named it bayonet grass.
