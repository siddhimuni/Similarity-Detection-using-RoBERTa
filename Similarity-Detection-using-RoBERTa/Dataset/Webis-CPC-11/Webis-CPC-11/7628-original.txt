Disappointment and vexation at defeat, it is said, rankled in this boy's bosom, and opened
a wound which closed only with life. Be this as it may, the classic rivalry begun at school
between Pitt and Murray became fiery strife between Chatham and Mansfield, fit for a civilized
world to witness and to profit by.

From Christ Church to Lincoln's-inn was a transfer of abode, scarcely a change of habits or
of life. Murray was four years nearer to his goal, but that goal had still to be reached, and
could only be won by untiring, patient, and ceaseless endeavor. At Oxford he had attended lectures
on the Pandects of Justinian, "which gave him a permanent taste for that noble system of jurisprudence."
