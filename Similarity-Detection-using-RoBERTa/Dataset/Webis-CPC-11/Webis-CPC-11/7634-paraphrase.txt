Although the divine conception and virgin birth of Jesus are central tenants of Christianity beginning in the early Christian church, there were objectors to this notion even then, some of whom even characterized this notion as a fiction. Cerinthus was one such, and he was alive at the same time as John the Apostle. As history advanced, movements like the Ebionites repeated these charges, and were documented by early Christian apologist Justin Martyr of Flavia Neapolis. There are variations, however, in the characterization of the objections, as some focus on disagreements with Jesus' divinity, suggesting that, whatever else he might be, he is either not God or not the Son of God, where other objectors focus more primarily and directly on the inability to accept birth to a virgin without necessarily addressing the question of divinity.
