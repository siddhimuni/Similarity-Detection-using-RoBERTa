The sound of horses and carriages resonates throughout the day. Then when autumn arrives and cool leaves fall, the visitors leave, and houses go unattended. Repairs are made where needed, and houses are decorated.

The wide streets are extremely smooth and flat, and occasionally crossed by intersecting roads. Each side of the streets are men and women going about their business, leaving the center of the street open for the occasional horse drawn carriage. The gentle sound of conversations flow from the shops in the evenings. In wintertime, the snow gathers along the pathways, lamp posts offer a welcoming glow along the streets, shining the way like stars in the night.

Mozart was ever so proud of the size of his hands and feet-but not of his accomplishment of authoring the Requiem or the Don Juan.

Burmese Dignity

Mr. Crawfurd, recalling his account of the Embassy to Ava, offers this tale of a Burmese minister. While sitting under an awning on the poop deck of a steam vessel, a heavy rain started to fall. "I suggested to his excellency that we go below deck, which he refused. He did not want to place himself under the feet of those that tread on the floor above him, this is a common concern for both Burmese and Siamese dignitaries. This is more directed at ladies, clearly proof of the state in which women are held. He turned to me and demanded to know if any woman had ever walked on the poop deck, and I assured him they had not. After some convincing, and seeing the storm grow worse, I eventually coaxed him into a cabin."

STEAM

Agathias established his knowledge of steam use in mechanical purposes in quotes made as early as the time of Emperor Justinian, when Anthemius, a philosopher, was using his power with Constantinople to try to shake the house of a litugious neighbor. It was also noted that Pope Sylvester II built an organ using the power of steam. Compared to recent ingenuity, these successes might remind you of a Frenchmen's boast of his country's flair with fancy clothing; and of the Englishmen's bragging of their invention of the shirt.

Medical Music

Sir Charles Blicke was a master of surgery, his protege, Sharp, was also a talented amateur of music, although his purpose of using music was intended for drawing patients in, not healing them. It was said that he "fiddled his way into practice, and fiddled his competing Dr., Mr. Pott, out of it". Mr. Pott was not in favor of such tactics, and had no intention of joining Sharp, and so he made quick effort to move west.
