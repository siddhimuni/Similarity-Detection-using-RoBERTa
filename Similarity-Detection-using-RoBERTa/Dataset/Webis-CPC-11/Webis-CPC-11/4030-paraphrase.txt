Wood carving in Madrid is different from that of other places such as Toledo and Eibar. Various metals are used in the craft, for example gold, silver, iron and copper. The reowned Spanish wood carvers have consistently upheld the their reputation for fabulous iron gate-work. Bronze is cast using the best technology, and much decorative work is produced for modern needs. Every two years, the Circulo de Artes holds an exhibition in Madrid, and the Government holds one every other year in the large permanent buildings which were built precisely for the exhibition at the end of the Fuente Castellana. Manufacturing of stylish and creative furniture and other related items are encouraged by a bi-yearly exhibition in Madrid, with prizes and commendations to be won. Artistic furniture is mainly made in Madrid, Barcelona, Granada and Zaragoza. Exhibitions are also held in intervals in principal towns for all types of art and craft, industries and manufactures. One example is the Bilbao exhibition of Spanish and South American productions in 1901, which was greatly successful.

We should also not forgot what Seville is famous for. The tobacco manufacturing industry, consisting mainly of women workers, is an extremely important industry, with thousands employed to produce cigars and cigarettes in factories, and preparing and packing the finer types of tobacco. Cigar-girls of Seville are held in esteem by their own, and feared by the authorities. Generally they consist of young, attractive women, who are extremely pronounced in dress and manners. When they choose to assert themselves they are a force to be reckoned with. More than once they have gathered in thousands for a common cause, for they are determined to get their way.
