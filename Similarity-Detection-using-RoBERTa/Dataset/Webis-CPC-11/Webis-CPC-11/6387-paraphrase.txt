And, were we to engage ourselves, rather than the Classics, in the Examination of Song Ballads and other remarkable Compositions of that Sort, in such Sections of our Existence, when we have attained a Maturity of Perception, it is not possible to assert what sort of amelioration perhaps would be achieved for Wit in general, and to the Artifice of Poesy in particular.  And for certain our Enthusiasms are described in them so artlessly, in such vivd, though not busy, Colors, that how much they might miss the Artfulness and Decorations of the Romans in their Style of Scripture, and in spite of it, are sure to entertain all such Readers who are not disqualified from the Entertainment by their Prestense or Benightedness,
 
It was my happy Accident some time back to have the Library of a Student given over to me for Custodianship, whereupon, besides a Number of valuable Authors heretofore unknown to me, I dove into a Tom Thumb and a Tom Hickathrift, Writers indeed better suited to sit upon the Shelves of Bodley or the Vatican, than to gather Dust in the Reclusivity and Obscurity of someone's private Den. I have browsed the first of these volumes with an overbounding Delight, and with more than an ordinary Devotion, and have tendered some Remarks concerning it, which hopefully are not deemed by the Publick to be objectionable; and no matter to what degree they might have been disparaged, and regarded as simply Entertainment for Youngsters, and those of the very early Years at that, or might be regarded as a Play not undeserved of the Attention of the Perceptive, and the Example of Superiority to the superb Poems of Chevy Chase, or the Children of the Wood. The Intention was obviously to encourage Virtue, and to demonstrate that however one might slave under the Limitations of Height or Disfigurement, or the Abasement of Family Origin, nevertheless, if one's Character and Deeds are extraordinary, those very Limitations that appear to drag upon him, may indeed shine a brighter spotlight upon his Nature.

There is an Array of Happenings, spread over the the entire Series of this Classical Poem, that yield a lovely Mirth and Astonishment, and are of the quality that Virgil himself would have attained, had the same story been spun by the Divine Poet, in particular, his tumbling into the Dessert-Bowl and other such, which demonstrate the Bravery and Firmness, the Assertiveness and Prodigiousness of Spirit of this wee Hero, while in the middle of the most stark Dangers that he could possibly encounter, and which are the unavoidable Circumstances of a Man's Life on this Earth.

I have checked with Monsieur Le Clerk, and my Chum Dr. B--ly about the History of this Writer, and they both reassure me that, though Neither can give a totally vetted answer, they can with confidence say that he is a Poet of ancient times, and it is likely that he was in fact a Druid, who, as mentioned by Julius Caesar in his Commentaries, would regularly proclaim their Precepts in Poetry and Meter. The Author of "The Tale of a Tub", thinks that he may have been a Pythagorean Philosopher, and have had a copy of the Metempsichosis; and Others believe he had at the least read Ovid's Metamorphosis, and was the first Individual to have come into possession of a Philosopher's Stone. A particular Accumulator that I know, who has forgotten more than he remembers, opined that he can hardly believe him to have existed at all, but that if he did, he must have lived some time prior to the Baronial Wars; which he proceeds to prove, as he has the Development of Religion in this Country, by Virtue of the engavings on an old Monument.
