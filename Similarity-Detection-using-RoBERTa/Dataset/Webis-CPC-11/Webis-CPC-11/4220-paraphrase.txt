The dinner party turns out to be an extravagant gala. 

The roasted pig was appetising with the garnishment of rosemary and  a fruit in its mouth. Then they served a plum casserol with roasted Turkey, and the dish was decorated with a long sausage. They also served some exotic birds such as geese and capons, and tongues with hams. As for deserts, they had a variety of pies.


As the Reverant sat down, he said it is very rare in these day to "see a great dinnre without fish"


Someone else replied that in the twelfth century fish was only used for religious fasting.

The marvelous air of christmas that was created, with the help of Mr Chainmail was being disrupted by the clamours of the guests.
