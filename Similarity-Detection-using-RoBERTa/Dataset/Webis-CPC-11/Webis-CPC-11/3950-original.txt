Having with some difficulty found shelter for the night, they proceeded on the following morning
in a boat to Ramsay; but here it was found that, owing to some informality, the people who
had possession of the house refused to give it up, and the wanderers were obliged to take refuge
in an inn. The next thing was to pursue, and recover the lost goods; but some weeks elapsed
before an opportunity of doing so could be found; and at length, when John did reach Liverpool,
the captain had left it, carrying away with him a considerable share of the property. With
the remainder, John, after many expenses and delays, returned to the island, and resumed his
business. But he soon discovered to his cost, that the calculations he had made were quite
fallacious, owing to his having neglected to inquire whether the late prosperous season had
been a normal or an exceptional one. Unfortunately, it was the latter; and several very unfavourable
ones that succeeded, reduced the family to great distress, and finally to utter ruin.

Relinquishing his shop and his goods to his creditors, John Glegg, heart-sick and weary, sought
a refuge in London--a proceeding to which he was urged by no prudential motives, but rather
by the desire to fly as far as possible from the scenes of his vexations and disappointments,
and because he had heard that the metropolis was a place in which a man might conceal his poverty,
and suffer and starve at his ease, untroubled by impertinent curiosity or officious benevolence;
and, above all, believing it to be the spot where he was least likely to fall in with any of
his former acquaintance.

But here a new calamity awaited him, worse than all the rest. A fever broke out in the closely-populated
neighbourhood in which they had fixed their abode, and first two of his three children took
it, and died; and then himself and his wife--rendered meet subjects for infection by anxiety
of mind and poor living--were attacked with the disease.
