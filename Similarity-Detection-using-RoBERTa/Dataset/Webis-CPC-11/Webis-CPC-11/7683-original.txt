     The second stage, a return to nature.--Diderot, d'Holbach
     and the materialists.--Theory of animated matter and
     spontaneous organization.--The moral of animal instinct and
     self-interest properly understood.

Here begins the second philosophic expedition. It consists of two armies: the first composed
of the encyclopedists, some of them skeptics like d'Alembert, others pantheists like Diderot
and Lamarck, the second open atheists and materialists like d'Holbach, Lamettrie and Helv√©tius,
and later Condorcet, Lalande and Volney, all different and independent of each other, but unanimous
in regarding tradition as the common enemy. As a result of prolonged hostilities the parties
become increasingly exasperated and feel a desire to be master of everything, to push the adversary
to the wall, to drive him out of all his positions. They refuse to admit that Reason and tradition
can occupy and defend the same citadel together; as soon as one enters the other must depart;
henceforth one prejudice is established against another prejudice.--In fact, Voltaire, "the
patriarch, does not desire to abandon his redeeming and avenging God;"[3313] let us tolerate
in him this remnant of superstition on account of his great services; let us nevertheless examine
this phantom in man which he regards with infantile vision. We admit it into our minds through
faith, and faith is always suspicious. It is forged by ignorance, fear, and imagination, which
are all deceptive powers.
