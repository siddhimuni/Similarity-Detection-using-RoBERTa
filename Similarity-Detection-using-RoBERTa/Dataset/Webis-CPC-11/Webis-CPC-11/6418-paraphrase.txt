In any case, I sincerely hope, because if it is conceivable that some of us are tired of the methods of Sherlock when we are given a long drink from them, no one will deny that they are acceptable when taking a small dose at a time. Sherlock, in short, is a national institution, and if he will close now and I always feel confident that Bosch claims to have killed. And that would be a shame. Of these eight best stories are "The detective dying" and plans "Bruce-Partington," but all are good to read, except perhaps "The Devil's Pie", which left an impression "more sinister" in the good old Watson mind, and step on my own.

Occasionally, a mass of war books grown so much that no reader can hope even to keep track of them, comes an extraordinary remedy. This is a statement which certainly can be an aviator Walking (BLACKWOOD), especially now when everything related to aviation - was going to say sur le tapis, but the phrase is not well chosen - so prominent in the approach. The author of these records modest but interesting veils his identity under the nom de guerre of the art "CONTACT." Without doubt, the whole history of war has no picture to beat this in devotion.

EVELYN Petter Branscombe has much that is interesting to say about men and women, and packages of thought (I run the risk of "your"), not a phrase Meredithian almost always escape the dark. But how much better this than a limpid stream of words without significant content! Souls in making (Chapman and Hall), especially an analysis of two episodes of love in the life of a young son of a liberal education soap ambitious self-made. The first - with Sue, the waitress pretty - is thwarted by an employee very persistent and unpleasant, and the second - with Virginia, a birth and raising children - is threatened by the intrusion of a younger cousin, a strange morbid dissolute . No action to speak of, so that you can not talk about it. I can only say that the interest of shrewd analysis of me and if my assumption about the gender of the writer is the sound be noted that more effort and ability are given the characters of men of the two girls, who are a little dark - charming unfinished sketches. There is a strength and a sense of personality in the writing of this novel lies in the large class of the competent authority.

Curious what has recently developed a mode of what I would call ultra-national school of fiction. Here is another example, Married Life (Cassell), in which Miss May Edginton, as, joins her hero and heroine to the top and left to drift for our edification in the midst of trials of marital happiness . I am afraid, but his big solution to the perennial problem of how to be happy though married seems to be the possession of a bank balance sufficient to prevent the chain of fatigue. In other words, do not be so married. All this talk about love-in-one information exchange that has no attraction for Miss Edginton. With it, the protagonists of, Osborne and his young wife, married just beginning their problems - problems of the national budget, kitchen and light the stove and the rest. (Incidentally, despite its carefully surveying British, I have strongly suspect the whole story of exotic origin, mainly from some strange sounding words that seem to have fallen into the here and there.
