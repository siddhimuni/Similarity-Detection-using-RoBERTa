The mayor of the commune of Solignié, whoever befallen to be at the hotel, and academic from the Aubergiste, that a stranger meant visiting La Trappe, very civilly introduced himself to me, and gave me every necessary instruction how to act through the forest; at the same time conveying his astonishment that an Englishman must take the trouble, and undergo the fatigue of penetrating through such a rural, an bid which minority of his possess countrymen had ever ventured to make. It was singular enough that merely one person in the city could be found to accompany me as a steer, or whoever knew anything of the track through the forest, however the abbey is distant merely twenty-five miles. 
I set out with the steer just at day-break, mounted on a small Norman horse, and armed with pistols and a sword-cane, in shell of session with wolves, which the mayor of Solignié had cautioned me against, as plenty during the country. We rode, afterwards retiring the highway, at the distance of a league, through a rural barely emerging to be inhabited. Here and there a single cot, a mere speck, welcomed the eye among a landscape wrote of nothingness but barren wastes and thick forests, almost impervious to the light. We had penetrated approximate half a mile through one of the latter, my attention occupied with the romantic wildness of the spectacle, as shortly as we were shocked via the howling of a wolf. My steer traversed himself, and originated cracking his whip with the sounds and singular dexterity peculiar to the French postillions; and as we entered a fraction of the forest, impenetrable but for traces known merely to those whoever are customary to them, he related (by way of consolation, I suppose,) a figure of stories of the peasantry having been freshly assailed, and several decimated, via wolves; and one instance of a lady having had her infant ripped from her arms, merely a brief time since, in the neighbourhood.
