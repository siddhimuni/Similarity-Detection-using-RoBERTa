Grand pa answered  him that his dad was in the HL.I and uncle Joseph sailed the sea, commander of a T.B.D and another uncle Jack was a Major. Then the anxious boy asked about him. He affectionatley stroked his  golden hair and told him that he was a 'general'. The old man mounted the little boy in his lap and narrated to him the stories of the past and the little boy was very keen and interested to hear about it.When the first war broke out everyone in the family were engaged in one or other work.
