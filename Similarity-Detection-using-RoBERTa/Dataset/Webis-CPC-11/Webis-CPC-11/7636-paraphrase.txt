Maitland left Tiverton after hearing nothing about the two people he was in search of. He reached Paddington still asking about them. The ticket collector and I through investigation had found them to be at Westbourne Park where someone took their tickets. But the mystery continues as no one had seen them in Paddington. Nobody saw the man in a fur coat with a young woman.

At nine o'clock Maitland arrived in Paddington totally frustrated by this folly of a hunt for his quarry.
