With that, and with a cry, he rushed on the Wanderer, his great axe swung aloft, to fell him
at a blow.

But while the giant had been singing, the Wanderer had shifted his place a little, so that
the red blaze of the setting sun was in his face. And as the mighty man came on, the Wanderer
lifted up his golden shield and caught the sunlight on it, and flashed it full in the giant's
eyes, so that he was dazzled, and could not see to strike. Then the Wanderer smote at his naked
right arm, and struck it on the joint of the elbow; with all his force he smote, and the short
sword of Euryalus bit deep, and the arm fell, with the axe in the hand-grip. But so terrible
was the stroke that bronze might not abide it, and the blade was shattered from the ivory handle.

"Didst thou feel aught, thou Man-eater?" cried Odysseus, jeering, for he knew from the song
of the giant that he was face to face with a wanderer from an evil race, that of old had smitten
his ships and devoured his men--the Laestrygons of the land of the Midnight Sun, the Man-eaters.

But the giant caught up his club of pine-tree in his left hand, the severed right arm still
clinging to it. And he gnawed on the handle of the stone axe with his teeth, and bit the very
stone, and his lips foamed, for a fury came upon him. Roaring aloud, suddenly he smote at the
Wanderer's head, and beat down his shield, and crushed his golden helm so that he fell on one
knee, and all was darkness around him. But his hands lit on a great stone, for the place where
they fought was the holy place of an ancient temple, old and ruined before King Mena's day.
He grasped the stone with both hands; it was the basalt head of a fallen statue of a God or
a man, of a king long nameless, or of a forgotten God.
