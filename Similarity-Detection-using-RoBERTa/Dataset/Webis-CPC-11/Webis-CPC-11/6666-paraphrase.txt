The judicial system soon produced a complex of custom, right, privilege and claim. The king's judges were heavily bribed for favors. The bribes vary according to the request or favor to be granted. Both the rich and the poor learnt that was the way of life.
Such an impression of the system was quite accurate. The judges were supposed to conduct themselves impartially but their decisions were often waylaid by payments from suitors in return for a favorable judgment. It was often heard from the shire town how a certain suitor got his claim by winning the favor of the judge with a flask of rare wine, a sumptuous feast or a prized hound or horse. 
It was rare to find a fair judge who took no bribes in the fifteen century. 
In 1470, Fuller of Chief Justice Markham revealed in his writng how a lady had contested the will of her husband in a lawsuit. She invited the judge to dinner to win his judgment in the suit which would go against her otherwise. 
After the dinner, the judge informed the lady that "no English lady of our time ever tried to bribe Sir Alexander Cockburn or Sir Frederick Pollock".

Chief Justice Dyer who died March 24, 1582, Whetstone, gives proof in his eulogy that Elizabethan England purity "was the exception rather than the rule with judges".
To quote "His processe juste, he tooke the poore man's parte." -the judge was ever ready to accept a bribe and do the suitor's bidding.
