A more perfect set-up of the same form has been observable for some time in London and Paris under the name of Cosmorama (from Greek terms signifying views of the world, due to the large number of different views involved.) Pictures, modest in size,  are placed beyond what appear to be nothing more than  common windows, but the panes are really large convex lenses fitted to correct the errors of appearance which the nearness of the pictures would otherwise make plainly visible. Adding to this effect  using various subordinate contrivances, even shrewd judges have been led to believe the small pictures behind the glasses are actually much larger than they appear, while others dwell upon them with admiration, as magical realizations of the natural scenes and objects. Many people pretend to dispise it because this contrivance is cheap and simple; However,  to have made such a  perfect  representation of objects,  is one of the most magnificent triumphs of art, whether we regard the pictures drawn in such accurate perspective and coloring, or the lenses which assist the eye in examining them.

"It has already been affirmed that the effect of such glasses in looking at near pictures, is similarly obtainable without the use of a lens, by making the pictures very large and placing them at a corresponding distance from the viewer. The rule of proportion states that a picture of one foot square at one foot distance from the eye appears as large as a picture of sixty feet square at a distance of sixty feet. The exhibition called the Diorama is merely a large painting prepared in accordance with this principle. It has no advantage over the cosmorama or the show box, to compensate for the greater expenses, other than the fact that many persons may stand before it at one time, near the true point of sight and derive the pleasure of admiration of it, without the risk of any slight motion changing the spectators point of view."
