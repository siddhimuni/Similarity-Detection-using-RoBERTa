Disappointed by the undeserved loss of the Love of a Husband with whom had been my place of joy! Regretful with the loss of my reputation by that man, and disgusted in having been used by him in ways more ungraceful and disturbing than a Slut would be! To be thoroughly embarrassed, and my great looks ripped away, all for no reason at all; what on this earth is more full of hate than him, or can destroy me to be nothing but depressed! But please God, (she spoke in a higher pitch now, hoping her husband would pick up on it, and he did) if you are even real, the true Defender of Honor, and God of Justice, Show mercy on me; for if I have broken these codes of honor or made a mockery of my marriage by breaking the bond; then strike me as I stand now. However, if I have been forever faithful and been all I can be to my husband, let me be restored, and let my destroyed nose be healed, as a sign that I have been everything but unfaithful.                                                                                       After stopping her begging to God, she was completely quiet for close to eight minutes, and then, as those her prayers had been heard and her nose healed, she yelled more to those who had listened: Please Heavenly Powers that know more than anyone how innocent I am, and have answered my calls by giving me my nose, accept my absolute thanks and know I am forever in debt to you: This miracle that you have granted me will show my husband that I have remained completely faithful. Now at the sight of how much pain he has cause me will show him that he really has wronged me, but oh I do still love him. Yet again I speak to you Powers in the Heavens, that have showed my faithfulness, again I say I love him so much. Please forgive him with me all the damage he has caused me, for at the time he was full of anger, an anger that had come from false implications and therefore he should be forgiven. And now again raising the pitch of her voice, she called to her husband, Come to me my love, and see that I never wronged you, but in turn that you wronged me, but oh how I forgive you.                                         Her husband, that had all the time been listening to her speaking, had no idea what to even think: He knew he had take a blade to her nose and rendered it straight from her face, and couldn't believe that it would be back on her face again; and so he believed his wife was playing a trick on him to somehow be released: But since she did call to him, and he actually did want to know the truth, he rose from his bed, lit a candle, and came downstairs to see the face of his wife, and with clear vision he saw the lady whose nose he had just cut off with a face that was completely intact; which confused him completely while at the same time shocked him, and he began to believe more in this heaven, which had revamped a nose for his wife, and made a miracle for her, that could show no mercy to him for the disgusting act which he did to his wife, and so he freed her immediately, and bringing her to bed, Oh you who are all good in this world and have remained faithful (said the changed Cuckold) Please show mercy on me for the horrible deed I did to you. Yes, my dear (answered the sly Slut) Since the Gods have heard my case and answered with a miracle to show my innocence, I will show show mercy on all now, especially you. So then the husband made a promise that from then on out he would not become angry and jealous with his wife, but let her be free to do what she please.                So as you can see how the Cunningness of an Old Bawn, a young woman was turned into a skank, and an old Dotard a young Cuckold. And also how all at once she can persuade all these events as she pleases and completely to he Pernicious Design; showing an answer to the Character of which the Wise-man gave to her, Her ways are always changing, and therefore one will never know what she will do next.                                                                           Chap. IV                                                                                                               How a Married Man, drawn in by a Bawd, kept his slut, which would ruin himself and family.                                                                                     The last chapter has showed us how our Bawd brought in a young wife to deceive her love, and cheat on him. This chapter shows how she tricks her husband into thinking what she is doing is not wrong, so it ruins him, his wife, and his entire family. For if she can but Rise, she cares not who she ruins.
