The subservience on the query of Slavery, which has until now characterized equally the immense parties of the nation, has strengthened the hands of the extremists at the South, and has enabled them to obtain the power of community view there by nurturing fake ideas of Southern advantage and Northern desire of attitude. We have finished so much to create them think in their significance to us, and specified them so little instance yet to suppose our significance to them, that we have taught them to consider themselves as the usual rulers of the state, and to look upon the Union as a errand decided to our fault, whose removal would be our spoil. Accordingly, they have mature further and additional demanding, till at extent the hack politicians of the Free States have turn into so imbued with the concept of yielding, and so powerless of believing in any standard of action superior than provisional expedients to take an choice, or some entity nobler than the simple control of workplace for its own sake, that Mr. Buchanan sternly proposes that the Republican party must pacify South Carolina by compromise the extremely faith that called it into survival and holds it jointly, the single fruit of its success that made conquest worth having. Worse than this, when the Free States by overwhelming majorities have just uttered their assurance, that slavery, as he creature of local law, can argue no lawful addition past the restrictions of that rule, he asks their approval to denationalize liberty and to nationalize slavery by an alteration of the Federal Constitution, that shall create the local law of the Slave States paramount throughout the Union. Mr. Buchanan would wait the yellow fever by abolishing the quarantine hospital and planting a superior virulent case or two in every community in the ground. 

We do not misjudge the importance of the current disaster, and we agree that nothing must be prepared to exasperate it; but if the citizens of the Free States have been trained something by the frequent training of sour practice, it has been that submission is not the seed of conciliation, but of contempt and violation. The wolf in no way goes for mutton to the mastiff.
