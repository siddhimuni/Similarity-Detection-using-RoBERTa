There the Volga, the Ural, the Sir Daria, and the Oxus discharge
their waters without reaching the ocean, but continue to bring life to the rapidly drying Transcaspian
Steppes, or connect by their river network, as the Volga does, the most remote parts of European
Russia.

The above-described features of the physical geography of the empire explain the relative uniformity
of this wide territory, in conjunction with the variety of physical features on the outskirts.
They explain also the rapidity of the expansion of Sclavonic colonization over these thinly-peopled
regions; and they also throw light upon the internal cohesion of the empire, which cannot fail
to strike the traveller as he crosses this immense territory, and finds everywhere the same
dominating race, the same features of life. In fact, as their advance from the basins of the
Volkhoff and Dnieper to the foot of the Altai and Sayan mountains, that is, along nearly a
quarter of the earth's circumference, the Russian colonizers could always find the same physical
conditions, the same forest and prairies as they had left at home, the same facilities for
agriculture, only modified somewhat by minor topographical features. New conditions of climate
and soil, and consequently new cultures and civilizations, the Russians met with, in their
expansion towards the south and east, only beyond the Caucasus in the Aral-Caspian region,
and in the basin of the Usuri on the Pacific coast. Favoured by these conditions, the Russians
not only conquered northern Asia--they colonized it.

The Russian Empire falls into two great subdivisions, the European and the Asiatic, the latter
of which, representing an aggregate of nearly 6,500,000 square miles, with a population of
only sixteen million inhabitants may be considered as held by colonies. The European dominions
comprise European Russia, Finland, which is, in fact, a separate nationality treated to some
extent as an allied state, and Poland, whose very name has been erased from official documents,
but which nevertheless continues to pursue its own development.
