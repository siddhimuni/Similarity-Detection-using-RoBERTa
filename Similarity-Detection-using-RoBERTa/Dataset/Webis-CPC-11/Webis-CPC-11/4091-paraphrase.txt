Bukhara and Khiva, though represented as vassal khanates in reality are mere dependencies of Russia. An approximately settled frontier line does not start until farther east, where Russian and Chinese empires meet on the borders of eastern Turkestan, Mongolia and Manchuria.

Russia has no oceanic possessions, and has abandoned those who had in the past century, the islands are mere appendages of the mainland to which they belong. Such are the Aland archipelago, Hochland, TÃ¼tters, Dago and Osel in the Baltic Sea, Novaya Zemlya, with Vaigatch Kolgueff and in the Barents Sea, Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea, the New Siberian Islands and the small group Medvyezhii of Islands off the coast of Siberia, the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, islands and Shantar Saghalin in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Aleutian archipelago was sold to the United States in 1867, along with Alaska, and in 1874 the Kuril Islands were ceded to Japan.

A variety of physical features is obviously expected in a territory like this, including on one side, cotton and silk regions Turkestan and Trans-Caucasus, and on the other moss and lichen tundra dresses Verkhoyansk Arctic and Siberian pole of cold - the dry desert regions Transcaspian and watered by the monsoons on the coast of the Sea of Japan. However, if the border regions, that is, two narrow bands in the north and south, left out of account, a striking uniformity of physical feature prevails. highlands, including the Pamir (the "Roof of the World") or Armenia, and high mountain chains, like the snowy peaks of the Caucasus, the Alay, the Thian-Shan, the Sayan, are met with only the periphery of empire.

Seen in general terms by the physical geographer, seems to occupy the territory north-west of the great plateau-belt of the old continent - the backbone of Asia - which extends to the decrease of the height and width of the high table of the land of Tibet and the Pamir to the lower plateaus of Mongolia, and then north east across the region to the utmost Vitim Asia.
