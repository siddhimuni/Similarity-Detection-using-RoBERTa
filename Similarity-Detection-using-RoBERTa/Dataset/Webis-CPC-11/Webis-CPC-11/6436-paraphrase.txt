But, though the irregular, contradictory, and unaccountable effects observed in these experiments do not as yet furnish any satisfactory theory, and though much is to be attributed to the circumambient air, yet the metallic substances 






Cavallo then proceeds to describe the experiments on contact electrification which were described in the previous paper referred to at the beginning of the article.





'The contact of different conductors, particularly the metallic, including pyrites and other minerals as well as charcoal, which I call dry conductors, or of the first class with moist conductors, or conductors of the second class, agitates or disturbs the electric fluid, or gives it a certain impulse. 






In a letter written to Gren in 1797 and published as a postscript to his letter of August, 1796, Volta says
