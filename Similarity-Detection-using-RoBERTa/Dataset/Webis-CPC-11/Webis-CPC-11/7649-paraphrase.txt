Richard, a constitutional cure, invites the municipality to his installation, yet, the ceremony was obstructed, due to the unruly behavior of the crowd, including women and children, and calls for his blood, saying he was Protestant, and married, and with children, and thus unable to enter the church.  The entrance was blocked by a crowd of women.  He was later installed on July 6th.
