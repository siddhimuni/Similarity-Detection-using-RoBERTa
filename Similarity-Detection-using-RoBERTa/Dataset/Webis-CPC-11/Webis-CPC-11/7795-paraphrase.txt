The thirst of gold everywhere precedes the yearn of instruction, and a taste for researches into antiquity; within everybody the mountainous portion of South America, from Merida and Santa Martha towards the table-lands of Quito and Upper Peru, the labours of absolute mining possess been undertaken towards discover tombs, or, as the Creoles say, using a word amended from the Inca grammar, guacas. When within Peru, at Mancichi, I went into the guaca from which, within the sixteenth century, masses of gold of great importance were extracted. No trace of the precious metals has been located within the caverns which possess served the natives of Guiana for ages as sepulchres. This circumstance proves that even at the period when the Caribs, and else drifting countries, made incursions towards the south-west, gold had flowed within very low quantities from the hills of Peru towards the eastern plains.

Wherever the granitic rocks do not show any of those wide cavities inflicted via their decay, or via an collection of their blocks, the Indians deposit their dead within the earth. The hammock (chinchorro), a kind of net within which the died had reposed during his life, serves for a coffin. This net is fixed tight round the body, a hollow is dug within the hut, and there the body is laid. This is the most habitual mechanism, according towards the fund of the missionary Gili, and it agreements with what I myself knowledgeable from Father Zea. I do not suspect that there exists one tumulus within Guiana, not even within the plains of the Cassiquiare and the Essequibo.
