THE LOOKED WITHOUUT ANY LIFE OR SOULAND TIRESOME .THE FOOTPATH WAS COVERED WITH MUD AND SLIME, PORTERS CARRIED   THEIR LOADS AND AS USUAL PASSENGERS WERE PUSHING ABOUT EACH OTHER TO FIND A FOOTING ON THE ALREADY DIRTY PAVEMENTS. A PORTER CARRYING  A HEAVY LOAD STUMBLED WITH THE OYAL REEFER WITH SUCH A THRUSTTHAT HE HAD LURCH SIDEWAYS AND HAD TO FACE A VOLLEYS OF FLASE MOUTHED  WORDS OR ABUSESCALLINMG HIM TO COME TO HIS SENSES FROM MIDDY OR A SAILOR WHO IN HIS OWN TERMINOLGY SHOUTED AT HIM ASKING HIM IF HE COUD NOT LOOK FOR A SHIP BEFORE HE HAD CRASHED  WITH  HIM.
            THE PORTER NOT BEIRNG IN ANY MANNER DISTURBED BY THE MARINERS ABUSIVE LANGUAGE CARRIED ON HIS PATH. AND THE SAILOR HAD TO CONTINUE ON THE WAY HE WAS GOING WHEN  SUDDENLY HE SAW A  MIDDLE -AGED MAN SUFFERING AND SHIVERING IN THE SEVERE COLD WITH A RED COLOURED NIGHTCAP ON HIS HEADAND COVERING HIMSELF AS FAR AS HE COULD MANAGE WITH AN OLD  AND NEARLY WORN OUT JACKET AND TROUSERS, A PAIR OF TORN SHOES ON HIS FEET TIED WITH RAGS OF CLOTH ATTACHED TO HIS LEGS.
              HE WAS NEITHER WEARING A SHIRT NOR STOCKINGSOR ANY OTHER CLOTHES. HIS FACE WAS EFFECTED BY THE BITING  COLD AND SEEMED AS HE HAD DURING HIS YOUTH  FACE AND BATTLED THE EXTREME CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE EQUATOR AND BOTH THE  NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLES AND FACED HIGH FAST BLOWING WINDS, SKIN BURNING HEAT AND MIND NUMBING BITING COLD CLIMATATIC CONDITIONS.
              HIS FACE  HAD GROWN THIN DUE TO MAL NUTRITION AND DUE TO HIS OVER GROWN BEARD SEEMED TO BE LOST IN IT.THE FACT COULD NOT BE WASHED OF THAT HIS OLDEST OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM OR IN OTHER WORDS HIS ACQUAINTANCE WOULD NOE3 FIND IT VERY  HARD TO RECOGNISE   HIS FACE AFTER SO LONG PASSAGE OF TIME.
                 HIS  NATURE HAD MADE HIM SO THAT HIS LIPS SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS SMILING AND HIS WOULD SHINE BRIGHTLY TO  PASSING PEOPLE WHO SHOWED ANY ACT OF KINDNESS TO HIM.HIS HIGH FOREHEAD GIFTED BY THE ALMIGHTY HOWEVER COMMANDED RESPECT IN HIS SUCH  PITIABLE CONDITION WHICH AT EVEN TIOMES OF HJARDSHIPS,DISEASE AND DISAPPOINTMENT HAD ENABLED TO SATISFY THE FIRE LIKE HUNGER OF  WHICH HAD FEEDED UPON HIS SENSES OF SIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE.
                  THESE TWO SENSES HAD BEEB BENUMBED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT ALTHOUGH THEM BEING THE MIRROR OF THE SOUL HAD BECOME LINED AND LOOKED LIKE AS IF DEEP GASHES OF WOUNDS HAD SOMEHOW CMPLETELY FINISHED THE  NEVER ENDING JESTFULL AND FUNFILLED NATURE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN AND SO HIS LIPSW HAD FALLEN IN DEJECTION OF THE SOCIETYAND AS IF HE  HAD VOWED TO  REMAIN SILENT ALAYS AND NEVER TO SPEAK.
                   THIS ACT OF HIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS VERY MANLY AS HIS WARRIOR LIKE  HANDS WERE FOLDEDAND HIS FACE BENT FORWARD IN SUCH A WAY TOWARDS THE GROUNDIN SUCH  A MANNER STILL REMAINING HALF UPTURNED AS IF MOCKING AT THE  RICH MERCHANTS AND  GOODS SELLERS PASSING  HIM RIDING ON CARRIAGES OR WALKING THAT ALL OF THEM WERE LIARSWHO SLEPT ON FEATHER FILLED BEDDINGSAND WHO HAD BECOME RICH DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF THE LABOURERS AND NOW FELT SECURE  ENOUGH TO ENJOY UPON THE FORTUNES SO COLLECTED.
                   THIS WAS  ALL DUE TO THE POOR WORKERS WHO TOILED FOR THEM FOR PALTRY SUMS  NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT TO FEED AND CLOTHE THEIR FAMILY ANDE DFEAR ONES.THE EXPRESSION ON HIS HIS FACE3 AND IN  HIS SPOKE THESE UNSPOKEN WORDS W2HICH HE HAD FELT SHAMEFULL TO EVEN CONVERT IT INTO HIS SPEACH
                   THESE POOR PEOPLE HAD FACED THE FAST BLOWING WINDS LIKE A SAILOR WHOSE SHIP HAD SUNK OR BROKEN TO A WRECK IN THE STORMY SEAS  AND HAD CLUNG PRECARIOUSLY TO A FLOATING PIECE OF DEBRIS TO SAVE HIS LIFE  .  
                 BUT NOW THE WAR TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MARINER WAS OVERBECAUSE OF THE NEGLECT METED OUT TO HOM BY THE SOCIETY OFTHE  RICH AND THE WELL TO DO.THESE PEOPLE HAD FELT NOT EVEN AN IOTA OF THE MISERY OF STARVATION AND LACK OF SUUFICIENT CLOTHING IN THESE  MISERABLE CONDITIONS OF BITING   COLD.
                 YET TIS MISERABLE STATUE LIKE FIGURE HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF A PASSING BY SAILOR  WHO HAD ONLY A PENNY IN HIS POCKET TO GIVE THIS MAN AQND AS HE HELT IN HIS POCKET TO GIVE IT TO HIM HE HEARD THE NOT SO STRONG VOICE OF A BLIND  WOMAN  AND HIS SENSE OF VIRTUE MADE HIM GIVE THE PENNY TO TO NEAR STARVED AND BLIND WOMAN              
               HE CAME INTO A CONFUSED  STATE OF MIND AS HE COULD NOT BE OF ANY HELP TO THE POOR MAN. EVEN THEN HE  TOOK UPON  HIMSELF TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THE MAN. IT WAS TGHEN HE SAW  A SMALL SCARON THE RIDGE OF HIS NOSE AS IF IT HAD BEEN INLICTED BY A SLINTER OF A SHIP.
              AFTER A LITTLE TIME A SENSE OF RECOGNITION PREVAILED I N HIS MIND .HE SOMEHOW SPOKE LOUDLY SIMILAR TO A SHOUT. HE SAID WHO BOB CLEWLINES AND SAID THAT T HE  BEGGAR LOIKE MAN WAS NON OTHER THAN AN OLD SHIPMAN OF THE SAME SHIP HE SAILED ON AND THE BOB WAS A QUARTER MASTER RANKED MARINER WHO HA D THE HEART OH THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE MAQN WHO HAD A HEART AS STRONG AS AN OAK WOOD.  
                  BOB WAS ALSO A VERY MERRY MAN IN HIS TIME AND ALWAYS BROUGHT HAPPINESS AND SPREAD IT AMONG HIS SHIPMATES LIKE AN EPIDEMIC.HE NOW SAIF QUIET LOUDLY AND THE PEOPLE PASSING NEAR HIM COULDCLEARLY HEAR HIM AND NOW GIVE SOME RECOGNITION TO TIS VALIAN MARINER OF HIS PERIOD HOW HE WAS MANNING A SHIP.
