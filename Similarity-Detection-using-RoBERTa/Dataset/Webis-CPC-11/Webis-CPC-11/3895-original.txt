This,
of course, is the same for every one, and therefore perfectly fair, but it does not tend to
elevate the style of play.

But the great difficulty at these competitions appears to be the difficulty of judging. And
here let me say at once that it is as far from my intention to find fault with any individual
judge as it possibly can be. Being English, I believe them to be above suspicion; being sometimes
a competitor myself, it would not be for me to impugn their honesty if they were not. Whatever
he does, I would always advise the athlete to preserve his faith in judges and a stoical silence
when he does not quite agree with them.

All I would suggest for the benefit of judges and judged alike in these trials of skill which
test the eyesight and quickness of the umpires almost as much as the eyesight and quickness
of the competitors, is that some definite code of scoring should be established and recognized
amongst the different schools-of-arms in England.

In order to facilitate the scoring they have a very good plan at the Military Tournament of
chalking the competitors' sticks. This precaution ensures a mark upon the jacket every time
the ash-plant hits it; but even this is not always sufficient, for it is quite possible for
a true guard to be opposed to a hard cut with a pliant stick, with the result that the attacker's
stick whips over and leaves a mark which ought not to be scored, for had the weapons been of
steel this could not have happened.

This, however, is a point which would generally be detected by one of the three judges in the ring.

What gives rise to question in players' minds is not any small point like this, so much as
the question of timing and countering.

To take the last first: If A and B lunge together, both making direct attacks, and both get
home simultaneously, it is generally admitted that the result is a counter, and nothing is
to be scored to any one.
