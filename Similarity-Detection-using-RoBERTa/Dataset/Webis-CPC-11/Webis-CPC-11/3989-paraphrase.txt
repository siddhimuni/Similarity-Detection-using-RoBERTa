This is done by placing the specimen on the table and turning him over gasoline or naphtha to reduce paint and then wiping dry pattern on both sides with an old material, or better, with common waste, such as machinists use cleaning machines, this is cheap and fast absorbing paint and naphtha. Keep up the light pattern to see if the holes are all clear, if not, wash it twice. Do not use model for powder immediately after it was washed, Let it dry a short time, otherwise dampened rubber block perforations.

To paint.

Take zinc white mixed with boiled oil around thick cream, add a little dry, like painters use. Store in a tin bucket (a holding about a pint is a good size), have a piece of board cut round with a screw in the center for a handle to fit poorly in the bucket, drop it on paint and will keep it from drying up. Add a little oil occasionally to keep from growing too thick paint, and will always be ready for use.

Brush.

Take a fine brush mold (or any brush with a square head), the wind is close to a string handle within half an inch from the end, it will be just stiff enough to distribute the paint well. Keep brush in water to keep it until dry, being careful to remove water before use.

Care models.

new models before being used, should be rubbed over the rough with the smooth piece of pumice stone, it is blurred Burr and stamping out clean and fine. When models are so large that they must be folded iron out wrinkles before using them. When using models for stamping powder, snap model to shake the dust from holes. After using these models for stamping paint should be washed thoroughly with naphtha until all holes are perfectly clear.
