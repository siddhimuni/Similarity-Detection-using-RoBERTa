John Tradeskin rewards our eyes by boxing up his writing.

Ashmole, in his diary published by Charles Burman in 1717, has 3 important entries which I have written exactly as noted.


"December"

"12, 1659"


Mr. John Tredescant died on April 22, 1662.

On May 30, 1662, this was entered: this easter, I sent a bill to Mrs. Tredescant for the writings that I had sold to her husband.

Although Ashmole's suit was well known amongst the locals, the whole matter didn't do too much for his image.

The loss of her husband's writings clearly upset Mrs. Tadescant.  In the diary on April 4, 1678, Ashmole writes,

My wife told me that Mrs. Tradescant was found dead and that she had drowned in the pond located on her property.


It appears that she had drowned the day before her body was found.


Hesther Tradescant was known because she had built the Tradescant monument on the grounds of Lambeth church.

She was buried in the vault where her husband and their young son John had been buried.

A monument to the memory of the Tradescants was built in 1162.  There are sculptures on the sdes of the monument.  On the north side are crocodiles, shells, and pyramids.  On the south there are broken columns and Greecian ruins.  On the east are the Tradescant's arms: a bent three fleurs-de-lys, and and impaled lion.  On the west side of the monument is a hydra, trees, a skull, and a tablet made of black marble.
The monument was repaired in 1773 and according to Sir John Hawkins, the following lines were insterted on he monument: formerly intended for an epitaph, inserted thereon.

Other authorities disagree with him and say that the lines were not added, but restored.
