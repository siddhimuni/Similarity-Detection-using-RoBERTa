Over the course of the past few weeks we have received several specimen of salmon from Maine.  The salmon have been caught in the nets of smelt fisherman and are very handsome.  These catches seem to prove that the schools of salmon are close to our shores when they are not in the rivers.  It appears that neither shad or salmon go east or south, but remain within 100 miles of the rivers where they are spawned.  The fish are in fabulous condition and perfect in appearance.

Mr. Cheney thinks taht the salmon taken from Cape Cod are from either the Merrimac or Penobscot River.  It seems that the salmon were caught at both the mouth of the Penobscot and at Cape Cod during the same year.  

In Northern New Jersey the recent catch of the salmon have been greatly discussed by not only local fisherman, but by the culturists and naturalists as well. 

For many years there were only a few salmon caught in the the Sandy Hook Bay, but this has increased in the last two or three years.  Mr. MC Lohsen, of the fishing center at Belford, states that some have been caught that weigh from 12 to 40 pounds.  It seems that an unusual amount of salmon were caught in nets in 1893.  Mr Harry White, also of Belford, did not catch any salmon in nets in 1893, but had caught 3 in the two years prior, with the largest weighing 17 pounds.  It seems that the salmon are only seen here during the month of May.  

In 1891 a 16 pound salmon was caught in a net and sold for $11.  In 1892 someone sold two salmon that weighed in together at 23 pounds for $15.95.

Near Long Branch some salmon were caught in nets directly from the ocean.  Mr Ed Hennessey from this area reported that in 1892 and 1893 he caught three salmon that each weighed between 10 and 15 pounds.
