School is not for the naturally good, but rather for those who can learn.  Controlling oneself can only be learned habitually through various acts of repetition.  If he depends upon others for such things, he will not be able to learn these for himself.  He must gain material in other ways.  At school he can do this, but when he is forced to do the natural, he loses the experience of reinforcing his ability to choose.  Freedom is the only way one can learn.
