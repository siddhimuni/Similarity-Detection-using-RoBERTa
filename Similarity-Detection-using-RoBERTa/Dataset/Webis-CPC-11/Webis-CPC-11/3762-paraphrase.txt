Eventhough the sacrifices offered by the kings,priests are according to the laws. For example kings like Saul(Samuel XIV35),Elisha (1Kings XIX21)are dedicated to proper deity.The "Book of Kings" describes the culture of Jerusalem and the Israel God. This is the most procedure of Gideon in Judges VI19-21 where this procedure is usual for Ophrah. geon boils the he-goat and bakes the cakes,places the ash on bread and meat in basket and both in a pot.Then the meal is prepared in altar flame. The same instance is followed in Pentateuch. There is only difference in legitimate and heretical.
