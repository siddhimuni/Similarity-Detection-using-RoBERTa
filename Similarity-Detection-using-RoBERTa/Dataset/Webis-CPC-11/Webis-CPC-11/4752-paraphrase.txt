However she swims along the line indolent lazy with pleasure, yet somehow hangs in waltz across circles, still bends to the tone-arm swing as hazel bonds to hidden treasure - but as for me, my days are over dancing.

Music grew deeper, more passionate, I sat and listened, - because she danced, then no more - our hearts beat time to it at Casement wandering wind played it since, I said without words, but every now and then looked the other eye, and was convicted there, suddenly turned away in shame.
