Have pity on her and pray for her. She deserves pity . She broke -off  from all the natural ties with her own wish which other people  cherish so intimately. To shut herself away from all the love and affection that deserve her at this age. She gave up all her earthly needs except each day's needs and accumulating  wealth which she already have enough. We should feel pity for her for this rather than harsh feelings."
    Janet said that she is sorry abou it and ashamed of herself for being so ill -tempered.It is not good for her to be arrogant who have been dependend of others from her birth itself.  She will do all the work assigned to her with the best of her ability .
     Agnes replied her that she is not at all offended.She know that if Janet is properly made to understand   she knew that Janet will be able to catch the matter. She also asked her that whether she is not curious at all about the nature of her new duties.
        Janet answerd that she have only little worries about it. She is much relieved by the fact itself that she is with  Agnes other than the ill-tempered Lad Chillington.
   Agnes  described her the duties that assigned to her.She will have to reach precisley at  eight in the morning to her ladyship's room. Sometimes she may not want janet otherwise she want her to read to her while she is having her chocolate or sometimes she want to play a game of backgammon with her before she gets up.
