Indirectly, through atmospheric electricity, nature achieves in large the thing that we occasionally work towards in a confined space by chlorine fumigation.

Here and elsewhere we see nature having an effect on two different things in one go. If the oxidizable miasma are demolished by atmospheric ozone they will cause, in turn, the atmospheric ozone to disappear, and as we have witnessed, that is in itself a miasm. Doubtlessly this explains why the ozone does not collect in the atmosphere in larger amounts than oxidizable miasma, ignoring the continual creation of both.

The idea that storms clean the air has always been widely held, and there is not much evidence to unseat this idea. We know for a fact that storms lead to increased creation of ozone. It is both possible and probable that occasionally, in certain areas, there might be more than a relationship between the ozone and oxidizable miasma in the atmosphere, and that the oxidizable miasma cannot be thoroughly demolished. Therefore, following the physiological impact and chemical character of these miasma, the miasma would apply a pronounced action on the economy of the fauna, and lead to disease among more of the individuals who inhale contaminated air. However many experiments have shown that as a rule, air includes free ozone, though in highly varying proportion. From this we can reach a conclusion that no oxidizable miasm that can exist in this air, in the same way that no oxidizable miasm can exist in air containing even a hint of chlorine.

I am not sure if, as forwarded by Mr. Hunt and others, it is true that when a pandemic, for example cholera, is underway, the ozone lacks atmospheric air.
