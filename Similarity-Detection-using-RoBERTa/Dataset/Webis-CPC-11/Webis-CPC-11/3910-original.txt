Of late years those roads have been allowed to fall into disrepair,
in order, it may be supposed, to check wagon traffic and to promote that by railway; apart
from the railway, communication with Delagoa Bay would now be impossible. What with the fever
climate in summer, and the formidable mountain barriers, the Transvaal high veldt is well protected
from aggression from the direction of Delagoa Bay. A few thousand men distributed at the few
mountain passes, blocking the tunnel at one of these (at Waterval Boven), and breaking up some
few bridges, would effectually arrest the progress of any invading force.

CLIMATE AND TOPOGRAPHY

From the tropical Zambesi regions and the torrid Kalahari plains, down to the 34th parallel
at Cape point, a great diversity of climatic conditions is met with. To the north and north-east
are the steaming, death-breeding low lands, abounding with dank virgin forests and scrubby
stretches; and to the north-west extend the arid, sandy, and stony levels. There are the temperate
and fruitful inland reaches along the southern and south-eastern littoral, and again further
inward the vast plateaux at 2,000 to 6,500 feet elevation, which represent nearly one-half
of the sub-continent with quite other climatic aspects. In the southern and western provinces
of the Cape Colony the rainy season occurs during the winter months, probably because of the
proximity to the trade wind influences prevailing over the South Atlantic; over the rest of
South Africa the winters are dry and sunny, the rains falling in summer, most copiously in
December and January, the effect being that there are hardly any winter rigours, and the heat
of summer is minimised. The most agreeable climate is that on the higher plateau levels: never
hot nor altogether cold, and yet virile and bracing; something like the climate on sunny days
found in the higher Alpine regions in summer and in the mild Algerine winters.
