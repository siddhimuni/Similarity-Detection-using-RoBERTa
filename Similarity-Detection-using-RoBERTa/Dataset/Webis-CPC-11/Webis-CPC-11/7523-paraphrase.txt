It is about "Darby and Joan" which reminds me of J.L. MOLLOY'S beautiful song with this title.

Rest of the music was not som interesting to those who think Opera is only of secondary standing.
Sweet Nancy might not have appeared bearing the incidents. Anyways  it was played nicely by Miss HUGHES,and now this is played Lancashire Lad, the aforesaid HENRY NEVILLE. I must see  it every evening for a thousand years (which I accept it a fa√ßon de parler even in China).If I were a fault finder then I would say that it is very long because some characters represents schoolboys, and  thirteen year old girl.
The orchestrator is Mr. BUCHANAN who is a  poet and a playwright.This courteous man has made his own peices successfully. He probablytalentedly  might have turned old plays into new ones. I really dream and hope for my next visit this great megalopolis and find his decode 'School for Scandal", and bring Hamlet new updated one. 

Yours always, A panelist FROM THE COUNTRY.

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY
 Nothing Special in this week Monday to Saturday.
Second Meeting in July at Newmarket  made many people go astray and thunder, hail and rain frightened more people on Thursday and also discuss about Esmeralda which I did not have to time to do previous week.Preferably when you start have a French libretto, composed by a English Composer which was played at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden.Regardless a huge achievement for everyone involved, from DRURIOLANUS downwards. No one would have desired a better Esmeralda than Madame MELBA,although she did not make that first charming song,"L'Hirondelle."
