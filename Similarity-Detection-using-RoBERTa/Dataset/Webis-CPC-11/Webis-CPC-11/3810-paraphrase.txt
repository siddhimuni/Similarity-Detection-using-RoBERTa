I'm embarassed to admit that some of my fondest childhood memories are of doing gymnatics on forms. These days, little girls do calisthenics and work out with ropes and giant strides. I hope they've also had a chance to learn how much fun it is to do gymnastics on forms.

As I've previously mentioned, most high school and college girls don't attend school in the afternoon. The current standards call for girls to arrive at 9:30 in the morning. They attend class until 1:30 in the afternoon, with a 30-minute break between 11:00 and noon. After class, the older students leave to work on homework assignments by themselves, while the younger students stay behind so that the teachers may continue to help them. I am concerned for the well-being of these students who remain at school in the afternoon. An afternoon meal is often provided, but few students take advantage of this offering. Some students simply cannot afford to purchase meals, while others find the lunchroom environment unpleasant. Whatever the reason, most of the girls prefer to bring a luncheon meal with them, and they do not have a complete meal until they return home.
