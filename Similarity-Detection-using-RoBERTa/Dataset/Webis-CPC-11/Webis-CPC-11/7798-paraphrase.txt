Yves Le Querdec argued that while some may believe it best to not trouble the minds of the common man with difficult or disturbing theological questions, he believed rather that honest dealing required a clear acknowledgement of these questions.  Furthermore, he warns us that if these questions are overlooked by those with pure motives, truly seeking  an honest answer to them they will rather be answered by those with less pure motives. He warns us that sooner or later all of these questions will be asked and that avoiding them give pretext and ammunition to the enemies of the Church. 

Cicero also urges us to present a complete truth when discussing history, saying in effect, "If we don't hear what is false we will not hear what is true.", the same can be said of apologetics.
