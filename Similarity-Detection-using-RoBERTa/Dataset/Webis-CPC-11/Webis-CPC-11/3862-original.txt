The electroscope is placed on a surface plate, or, at all events, on a sheet of plate glass,
and a "scribing block" is placed along side it and the scriber adjusted to dip into the kerosene
to any required depth.  This is done by twisting a bit of wire round the scribing point and
allowing it to project downwards.  The point itself serves to give an idea of the height to
which the vessel may be filled.  The liquid is adjusted till its surface is in contact with
the end of the scribing point, and the wire then projects into the liquid and forms an electrode
of constant area of surface.  The scribing block is put to earth.  A charge is given to the
electroscope, and the time required for a given degree of collapse of the leaves noted.

The kerosene is then removed and its place taken by vaseline or paraffin, known to insulate
well as a standard for comparison.  The experiment is then repeated, and the time noted for
the same degree of collapse.  This test, though of course rough, is generally quite sufficient
for workshop purposes, and is easily applied.  Moreover, it does not require correction for
electrometer leakage, as generally happens when more elaborate appliances are used.

The actual resistance of insulating oils depends so much on the electrical intensity, on the
duration of that intensity, and on the previous history of the oil as to the direction of the
voltage to which it has been subjected--to say nothing of the effects of traces of moisture--that
quantitative experiments are of no value unless they are extremely elaborate.
