It seems to me sufficiently abundant, but not flexible enough and vigorous, but commonly quails under a powerful concept, if you maintain the dignity of his style, often perceived as a flag and languish under you, and there are steps America as a relief, as Greek does to others.

The sciences deal with things very finely, after an artificial, very different from the common and natural way. My page makes love, and understands it, but I read Leo Hebraeus - [Leo the Jew, Ficinus, Cardinal Bembo, and Mario Equicola wrote treatises about love.] - And Ficinus, which speaks of love, thoughts and actions, means no. I do not find in Aristotle most of my normal moves, but they are there covered and disguised in another suit for the use of schools. Good speed of them! if I were in trade, which would naturalize art as much as artificialis nature. Bembo and Equicola let alone.

When I write, I can very well spare both the company and the memory of the books, not to interrupt my progress, and, in truth, the best authors too humble and discourage me: I am very mind of the painter who having represented the majority of the cocks terribly bad, not charged, all their children to suffer any natural cock into her tent, and there was no need to give me a bit of brightness, of the invention Antigenides the musician, who, when asked to sing or play, took care beforehand that the auditorium should, either before or after being satisfied with some other ill musicians. But I can not be without Plutarch, who is so universal and so full that at all times, and the extravagant soever order to take in hand, will still be in his elbow, and keep you a liberal and not be exhausted hand of wealth and finery.
