A more striking picture you cannot imagine. The stream is remarkably clear and rapid,
the bottom rocky, and its banks, for a considerable distance, are literally perpendicular rocks.
The Aar is a perfect specimen of the mountain torrent; it rises in the Eiffel mountains; and,
I am told, in the winter does much mischief by inundations. It put me in mind of the Welsh
rivulets, particularly some parts of the Dee. This d√©tour having taken up more time than I
expected, I reached Brohl, late, but in time for the supper at the rustic Gasthoff, which,
with a flask of Rhenish wine, and the company of an agreeable German tourist who was staying
there, made ample amends for the fatigues of the day.

In setting out from Brohl by the stream of the same name, which runs down from the Lake of
Laach, where I was struck with the pieces of pumice-stone, and the charred remains of herbs
and stalks of trees scattered over the marshes. I soon came to the valley, the sides of which
are composed of what is called, in the language of geology, tufa, and in that of the country,
dukstein, or trass. It is a stone, or a hard clay, of a dull blueish colour, and when dry,
it assumes a shade of light gray. An immense quantity is quarried throughout the valley, and
is sent down the Rhine to Holland, where it is in great request for building. The village of
Nippes owes its origin to the trade in trass, having been founded by a Dutchman, who settled
there about a century ago for the convenience of exportation. The lower part of the mass is
the hardest and most compact, and is therefore preferred by the quarrymen; as it rises, the
upper part becomes loose and sandy, and unfit for use. You must not suppose the stream to be
clear like the Aar, for it is as thick as pea-soup, and about the same colour, being in fact
a river of trass in solution.
