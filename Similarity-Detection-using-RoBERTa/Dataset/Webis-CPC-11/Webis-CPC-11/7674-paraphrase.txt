The considerable public discontentment regarding this text requires that there be an amenable end to it.  Thus a sequel is shown in what the Australians refer to as the biggest "bloody dingo[6] politeful" way.

Chapter I.

A dirty-faced young man ran into another young men who looked the same.  The former said "betcha don't know what two times two is"

"You stupid ---" (We have to remove what was actually said, but one might say a type of ancient instrument) "two times two is four." "Insteresting" said the latter young man.

Now, you may not see it, but I do.  This seemingly harmless conversation is central to the outcome of the trials of William ravenshoe, the wrongful-rightful, rightful-wrongful, and blah blah blah heir.
