Deviations from the teeth.

Irregularities of the teeth can be caused by uneven wear of some teeth or have broken some teeth, what can happen when the cattle pastures on sandy soil or worse. Molar teeth may also show, from similar causes irregular wear, or a disease or malformation of the jaw. their edges may become clear, or it may happen that a molar tooth was accidentally broken. This may also occur that a supernumerary tooth developed in an unusual position, and that interfering with natural mastication and regular feed.

Treatment .-- mouth can be examined by a hand grasping the animal language and partially withdraw from the mouth, so as to expose the incisor and the molar teeth of inspection. When desired, however, to examine the molar teeth with your fingers, so as to obtain a better idea of their condition, an iron instrument which is used to Balling like a horse should be put in the mouth, so to separate the jaws and keep them apart while the examination is performed. Any sharp edges must be eliminated by molar tooth rasp, as used for horses. A supernumerary tooth that interferes with chewing or tooth is broken or loose should be removed. When performing such operations is desirable to throw or cast, animals, and be sure the head was held so as to enable the operator to do what is necessary without difficulty.
