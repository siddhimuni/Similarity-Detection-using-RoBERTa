There is no statistical account of England, published recently, we can find, which could give us no idea of the correct current average rent of land in this country, [31], but we believe, of all information they were able to acquire, through a survey directed by competent and knowledgeable people that can not be set at less than 25 years. An acre. Irish find the last census, that Ireland contains 20399608 status acres, and estimated rental is L12, 715 478 - obtaining a trifle over 12s. the average rent. [32] When it is considered that the tenant pays tithing English - which in many localities, amounting to more than the average rent the entire product from Irish soil, that he pays low rates, and that it is charged hard to turnpikes and other local assessments: and that the Irish tenant does not pay tithe, and only half the rates low, there is no turnpikes, except the solitary near cities or large towns, that, in fact, only tax he pays is the process of the county, varying in different districts of one and sixpence tenpence biennial source, and that this assessment is considerably reduced New Grand Jury acts in which cities and houses are assessed and taxed gentlemen - when say, all things are considered, and moreover, that the land in Ireland is naturally better and more productive than English soil, we think we have eliminated sufficiently grave a charge against the Irish and their owners have showed that this is not excessive pecuniary burden which he moans, causing big difference between the social condition of Ireland and the English occupant.

It will undoubtedly be said - "Ah, but English is housed tenant, and the farm was kept in repair by the owner, while Ireland is obliged to do all this himself!" This is true, but surely the Irish tenant costs on his farm, but made a small addition to his other commitments. Gates and fences is compared speaking, no one and, if they are high for him, rather they are suffered to go to ruin.
