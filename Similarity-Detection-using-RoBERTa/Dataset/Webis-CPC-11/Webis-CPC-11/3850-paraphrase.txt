Chevalier, with the gratest air of courage imaginable, rose, and having dressed himself, said to Levingstone--'Me must beg de favour of you to stay a few minutes, sir, while I step into my closet dere, for as me be going about one desperate piece of work, it is very requisite for me to say a small prayer or two. Accordingly Mr Levingstone consented t wait whilst Chevalier retired to his closet to pray; but hearing the conclusion of his prayer to end with these words--'Me verily believe spilling man's blood is one ver' great sin, wherefore I hope all de saints will interced vid de Virgin for my once killing Monsieur de Blotieres at Rochelle,--my killing Chevalier de Cominge at Brest,--killing Major de Tierceville at Lyons,--killing Lieutenant du Marche Falliere at paris, with half a dozen other men in France; so, being also sure of killing him I'm now going to fight, me hope his forcing me to shed his blood will not be laid to my charge;'-quoth Levingstone to himself--' And are you then so sure of me? But I'll engage you shan't--for if you are such a devil at killing men, you shall go and fight yourself and be---'Whereupon he made what haste he could away, and shortly Chevalier coming out of the closet and finding Levingstone not in the room, was very glad of his absence.'

Some time after, Chevalier was called to account by another gentleman. They met at the appointed hour in Chelsea Fields, when Chevalier said to his adversary--'Pray, sir, for what do we fight?' The gentleman replied-'For honour and reputation.'Thereupon Chevalier pulling a halter out of his pocket, and throwing it between and his antagonist, exclaimed-- 'Begar,sir, we only fight for dis one piece of rope--so e'en WIN IT AND WEAR IT.' The effect of this jest was so great on his adversary that swords were put up, and they went home together good friends.
