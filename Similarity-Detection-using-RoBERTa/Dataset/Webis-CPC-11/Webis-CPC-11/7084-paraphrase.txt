When his Majesty saw Oberon in dress made from the wood material which looked liked wood he belived in all the things he said but when he saw Mr Barker's Oberon standing like a painted graven idol with yellow cheeks and red eyebrows you did not believe him. He was saying that he knew the bank where the wild thyme blows. You did not believe him simply because you knew he dont know anything of this kind.

Shakespeare was looking decnt. Golden dress of the fairies was the thing I liked the most. Puck was going on my nerves and thankfully he was not there. His colour of the shrieking suit destroyed the colour scheme. It was matching with only vermilion eyebrows.

Simple chain on the green mound with English tunes had a graceful impact. They lacked the space in the movements in whole play especailly in last scene where they interlace among the staring columns. The lights were less on the stage from 12.6 muzzles extended from the bulwarks of the dress circle.

Except in the Mr. Barkers intensions there was no distance, suggestion of the spirit world and sense of mystery.

The haunt of Titania with its background of Libewrty curtains very cleverly disposed was the best scene. They were superb as a drappery but as symbols of a forest it was little arbitary. The fault was with me as I did not understood the idea of bird's nest in the spectable of hanging drapery. I would have grasp the same more easily if forest was indicated with couple of trees in tubs or even single tree only if you were short of foliage.
