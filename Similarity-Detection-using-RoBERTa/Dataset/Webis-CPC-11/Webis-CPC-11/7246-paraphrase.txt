Bishop Cosin was of opinion that when the Church enjoined her Priests and Deacons to communicate every Sunday at least, she supposed it "ought and should be done by them oftener. And from hence was it that the Collects, Epistles, and Gospels were appointed upon the Sundays and Holy-days, and a rubric made at the beginning of the Service Book for the Collects, Epistles, and Gospels to serve all the week-days, that were used on the Sunday--that is, at any time when there is a Communion on the week-day.
And, certainly, though it be no fault to read the Collects, Epistles, and Gospels either upon Sundays or week-days; yet to read them, and not to go on with the Communion, is contrary to the intent of our Church, that, if there were any company, intended a Communion every day, for the continuing of the daily sacrifice in the Church, ever used till Calvinism sprung up, and leaped over into England."[i]

It was a principle affirmed by Hooker and Archbishop Laud as well as by Bishop Cosin, and still later by Archbishop Sheldon in 1670, that the practice of cathedrals or mother churches was intended to be a pattern for that of parochial churches.

Wherever, therefore, the Clergy form a company sufficient for communion they ought not to communicate less often than every Sunday, and may well do so oftener, even daily; and wherever a company of communicant laity desire a like privilege, they are not debarred from it by this rubric.
