Sherlock's methods are digestible when taken in small quantity, but not so if taken in large size.I sincerely hope  it is conceivable to some of us and grow weary of it. Sherlock is a national institution, and if  to be closed now and for ever I feel sure that the Bosches will claim to have finished him off. And that would be a pity. Of these eight stories the best are "The Dying Detective" and the "Bruce-Partington Plans," but all of them are good to read. The "The Devil's Foot," left a "most sinister impression" on dear old Watson's and the reader.

Often  a mass of War-books grow  vast that no single reader can  keep count of them. There emerges one of particular appeal. This is a claim that may certainly be made for An Airman's Outings (BLACKWOOD), when everything associated with aviation is sur le tapis, but the phrase is hardly well chosen--so conspicuously in the limelight. The writer of these modest but thrilling records veils his identity under the technical nom de guerre of "CONTACT." Surely the war is pictured devotedly.

EVELYN BRANSCOMBE PETTER has much interesting to say about men and women, and packs "her" thought. The "her"  phrasing is a bit dark.  A easy intelligible flow of words without notable content. Souls in the Making (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is mainly an analysis of two love episodes in the life of a young man. The first--with Sue, the pretty waitress--is defeat plans by a very persistent and unpleasant clerk. The second--with Virginia, a girl of birth and breeding--is threatened by the intrusion of the girl's cousin, a queerly morbid ne'er-do-well. There is no action to speak. the interest of the shrewd analysis held me, and that if my guess as to the sex of the writer be sound it is noteworthy that more pains and skill are bestowed upon the characters of the men than of the two girls, shadowy--charming unfinished sketches. There is a vigour and an effect of personality in the writing that put this novel above the large class of the merely competent.

A transient fashionable has lately developed for 
the ultra-domestic school of fiction. Here is another example, Married Life (CASSELL), in which Miss MAY EDGINTON, following the mode, unites her hero and heroine at the beginning and leaves them to flounder for our intellectual with double blessedness. The eternal problem of How to be Happy though Married appears to be the possession of a sufficient bank-balance to prevent the chain from vexing. The stage of not to be too much married. All this love-in-a-cottage talk has clearly no allurement for Miss EDGINTON. With her, the main character, Osborne and his young wife, are no sooner wed than their troubles begin. The domestic budget, of cooking and stove lighting and the rest begins. (By the way, for all its carefully British topography, I strongly suspect the whole story of an exotic origin, chiefly from certain odd-sounding words peeping here and there.)
