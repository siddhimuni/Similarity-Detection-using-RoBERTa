In my opinion churches can improve the minds of people. When the church bell rings on sunday the soul of people may rise to god. In the peaceful gathering of the church people may repend, put their faith in god, became hopeful, keep away from sin,  all this may happen. Sundays may become renewal days for  the souls.All these things happens only to a very few who are pious and godfearing.But does churches renovate an ordinary person. How many are consoled by the  gospel? How many of them can understand the inner meanings of the gospel.How many people can put away their sins and come towards the happiness of god? Only a few aexperience all these.But instead of all this churches prove to be good for the people. Eventhough they are not  achieving the aim .
       The main of the evil of the church is that the priests of the churches are not well experienced. Of course 90%  of the priests are pure minded and and well- intentioned people. But they have not seen the world. They does not experience the difficulties  faced by the common men. They can make nice speeches, advice and preach. They are not able to understand the difficulties in practising it.  After the studies  in seminary  they settle in as a priest in a long estalished church. They dont have any experience about cheatings ,evils and many other problems a common man have to face.
