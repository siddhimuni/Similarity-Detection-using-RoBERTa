The manufacturers here, at Lyons, deserve a volume, and I shall scarcely give them a page;
though nothing I ever saw at London or Paris can compare with the beauty of these velvets,
or with the art necessary to produce such an effect, while the wrong side is smooth, not struck
through. The hangings for the Empress of Russia's bed-chamber are wonderfully executed; the
design elegant, the colouring brilliant: A screen too for the Grand Signor is finely finished
here; he would, I trust, have been contented with magnificence in the choice of his furniture,
but Mr. Pernon has added taste to it, and contrived in appearance to sink an urn or vase of
crimson velvet in a back ground of gold tissue with surprising ingenuity.

It is observable, that the further people advance in elegance, the less they value splendour;
distinction being at last the positive thing which mortals elevated above competency naturally
pant after. Necessity must first be supplied we know, convenience then requires to be contented;
but as soon as men can find means after that period to make themselves eminent for taste, they
learn to despise those paltry distinctions which riches alone can bestow.

Talking of Taste leads one to speak of gardening; and having passed yesterday between two villas
belonging to some of the most opulent merchants of Lyons, I gained an opportunity of observing
the disposal of those grounds that are appropriated to pleasure; where the shade of straight
long-drawn alleys, formed by a close junction of ancient elm trees, kept a dazzling sun from
incommoding our sight, and rendering the turf so mossy and comfortable to one's tread, that
my heart never felt one longing wish for the beauties of a lawn and shrubbery--though I should
certainly think such a manner of laying out a Lancashire gentleman's seat in the north of England
a mad one, where the heat of the sun ought to be invited in, not shut out; and where a large
lake of water is wanted for his beams to sparkle upon, instead of a fountain to trickle and
to murmur, and to refresh one with the idea of coolness which it excites. Here, however, where
the Rhone is navigable up to the very house, I see not but it is rational enough to form jet
d'eaux of the superfluous water, and to content one's self with a Bird Cage Walk, when we are
sure at the end of it to find ourselves surrounded by an horizon, of extent enough to give
the eye full employment, and of a bright colouring which affords it but little relief. That
among the gems of Europe our island holds the rank of an emerald, was once suggested to me,
and I could never part with the idea; surely France must in the same scale be rated as the
ruby; for here is no grass, no verdure to repose the sight upon, except that of high forest
trees, the vineyards being short cut, and supported by white sticks, the size of those which
in our flower gardens support a favourite carnation; and these placed close together by thousands
on a hill rather perplex than please a spectator of the country, who must wait till he recollects
the superiority of their produce, before he prefers them to a Herefordshire orchard or a Kentish
hop-ground.
