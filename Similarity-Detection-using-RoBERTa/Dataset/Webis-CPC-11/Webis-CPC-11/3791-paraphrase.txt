Bartlett provides a "Reverie Poétique" - a climax of success, a scholarly inspiration. His scherzo will be very welcome to the meagre body of American scherzos for its festivity and originality. Its richly harmonized interlude shows is a great gain in strength as well as individuality and a complete emancipation from the overpowering influence of Chopin.

In his songs Bartlett has a quality uniformly higher than that of his pieces for piano. The delicacies of harmony in "Moonbeams" are pleasing and "Laughing Eyes" is a fitting setting of Mr. "Nym Crinkle" Wheeler's exquisite lyric. "Come to Me, Dearest" has nice details but is unfortunately cheap in general design.

Bartlett contributed largely to "The St. Nicholas Song Book," a collection of children's songs. His lyrics are unique and enjoyable, and "I Had a Little Pony" will become a nursery classic.

It surprises me to praise a song about a brooklet; but the truth is, that Bartlett's "I Hear the Brooklet's Murmur" is superbly beautiful, regretful, and a noble song. It is one of his songs typifying German style. It represents the late German type of Lied, as the earlier heavy style is exemplified in "Good Night, Dear One." The airiness and grace of "Rosebud" is very Teutonic.

Not all of his work is pleasing. In his "Lord God, Hear My Prayer," Bartlett rather disastrously attacks the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria".  While Gounod is passionate and unrestrained, Bartlett is overly cautious. He chooses a Cramer étude, and adds to it parts for voice, violin, and organ.
