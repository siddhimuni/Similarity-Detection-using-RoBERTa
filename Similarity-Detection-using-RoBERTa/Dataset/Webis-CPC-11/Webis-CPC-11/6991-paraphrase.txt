The message was left with Dr. Rewkes by Weyburn himself. Lord Ormont did not need attention from a doctor at the present he thought. To explain his lateness, Wayburn told Lady Charlotte that he had been on summons. 

She remarked, "Oh, that's why he hasn't come yet." We can sit and converse until he arrives. I wonder if he is upset. He can't sweet-talk me like he does to others. His Lady Ormont! I don't buy it for a second,Morsfield or not. And now the poor fool is stuck in this situation, like the dragonflies of my grandson, Bobby. I don't want to say anything else about him, but Lady Ormont is not welcome at Steignton!
