The question may not be that simple. These
visible differences, then, enable us to separate the kinds of line within this print.

The author has attempted, by tracing only the etched lines in the print, to recreate the state
of the plate after Rembrandt's etching and before the application of drypoint (figure 12).
It can be seen that Rembrandt's etched lines form only a foundation or skeleton for the finished
work. It is in no sense complete in itself. More important, the picture lacks all the rich
contrasts of light and shade which distinguish this print and most of Rembrandt's finished work.

It has been generally assumed that Rembrandt went through a fairly normal process of stopping-out
and also re-etching in the course of his print-making. The visual evidence would indicate that
he did not follow this procedure here. Stopping-out is, of course, a means of creating variations
in the printed intensity of etched lines. After a plate has etched for a certain time--depending
on the artist's inclination--it may be removed from the acid and some of its lines covered
with a stop-out varnish, similar in texture and acid resistance to the basic ground. The plate
is then put back in the acid and the remaining lines etched more deeply. This can be repeated
any number of times, giving a wide range of intensity to the various etched lines. No such
wide range of etched lines appears in the finished print. Further, where the edge of applied
stop-out varnish crosses a single line, the change in depth of acid biting at that point is
readily visible.
