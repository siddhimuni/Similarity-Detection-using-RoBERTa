On the floor of each of the electric-boxes, W, was an oak board 1 cm. in thickness, which carried electric wires by means of which the mouse could be shocked in W when the tests demanded it

Thence by pushing open the swinging door at I, it could pass into the entrance chamber, B. Having entered B it could return to A only by passing through one of the electric-boxes, marked W, and following the alley to O, where by pushing open the swing door it could enter the nest-box
