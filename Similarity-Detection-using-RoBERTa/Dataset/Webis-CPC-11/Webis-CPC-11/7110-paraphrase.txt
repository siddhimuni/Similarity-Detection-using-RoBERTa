A rich soil furnishes too many nutrients.  If growing in a cold climate the plant can grow very large and lush. If itt becomes overcharged with water the equilibrium of the chemical proportions necessary for the formation of natural juices become deranged at the expense of quantity and quality of the volatile oil produced.

These facts, long ago pointed out by Linn√¶us, have been verified in England. Some years ago a disease manifested itself in most plantations, which was not understood by the growers and was not remedied. The acreage under cultivation decreased, and partly owing to this and a scarcity occasioned by a failure in the crop, the price of the oil rapidly rose from 50s. to 200s. per lb. Consequently, with the continually increasing demand, and the continued rise in price, manufacturers of lavender water and of compound perfumes in which oil of lavender is a necessary ingredient commenced to buy the French oil.  Vendors of the English oil commenced to dilute largely the English with the French oil.


By degrees the French oil become almost entirely substituted in England for the English, and at present it is difficult to purchase true English lavender water of superior quality.  Only a few first class houses offer oil equal to that available twenty years ago.

Large profits for chemists and druggists, and the incomprehensible will of the public to buy anything cheap,have encouraged a marvelous increase in the figures of the imports of French (and German, which is worse) oil.

In 1880, when the price had reached 125s. per lb., it was pointed out by an eminent London firm that unless the cultivation in England were extended, the price would become prohibitive.  There was a fear inferior oils would be introduced into the market, and so destroy the popularity of this beautiful perfume.
