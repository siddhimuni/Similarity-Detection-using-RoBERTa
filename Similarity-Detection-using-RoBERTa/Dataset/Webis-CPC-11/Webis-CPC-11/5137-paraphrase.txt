Hamilton's instinct for law resembled genius,pointed out in the Federalist that  a writing which cannot give protection and get it only by intelligence and the sense of justice of the community itself.

The general genius of a Government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects, is the truth. Particular provisions have  less virtue and efficiency than are commonly expected from them. The want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good Government, after an experience of nearly a century and a quarter, I think that Hamilton was right. In the United States we have carried bills of right and constitutional limitations to an extreme, I suppose that few would care to maintain that, during the nineteenth century, life and property were safer in America, or crime better dealt with, than in England, France, or Germany. The contrary, indeed, I take to be the truth, and I think one chief cause of this imperfection in the administration of justice will be found to have been the operation of the written Constitution.  Under the American system, the Constitution, is set forth by judges,in essence  this function is political. This has brought precisely the quality of pressure on the bench which  has been the labor of a hundred generations of our ancestors to remove.  The result has been not to elevate politics, but to lower the courts toward the political level, a result which conforms to the a priori theory.

The abstract virtue of the written Constitution was not, a question in issue when Washington and his contemporaries set themselves to reorganize the Confederation. Those men had no choice but to draft some kind of a platform on which the states could agree to unite, and accordingly they met in convention and drew the best form of agreement they could. I  suspect that Federalists were quite alive to the defects in the plan which they adopted.

Hamilton was outspoken the English model, that Washington ever expressed a preference for the theory. A written fundamental law, the court should nullify legislation. It is not unworthy of remark that all foreigners, after a prolonged and attentive observation of our experiment, have avoided it. Since 1789, every highly civilized Western people have readjusted their institutions at least once. No one has in this respect imitated us, though borrowed  from the parliamentary system of England.[6]

Canada our neighbor, with similar traditions and a population similar to ours, has been no exception to the rule. The Canadian courts indeed define the limits of provincial and federal jurisdiction as fixed under an act of Parliament. They do not pretend to limit the exercise of power when the seat of power has been established. I take the cause of the distrust to be obvious. Although our written Constitution was successful in its primary purpose of facilitating the consolidation of the Confederation, it has not otherwise inspired confidence as a practical administrative device. Not only has constant judicial interference dislocated scientific legislation, but casting the judiciary into the turbulent flow of civil faction has degraded it in the popular esteem.  The American bench, because it deals with the most fiercely contested of political issues, has been an instrument necessary to political success. The  political parties have striven to control, the judiciary and therefore the bench always had a boldly partisan bias. This boldness political or social bias has, bred among the American people the conviction that justice is not administered indifferently to all men. The bench is not respected with us as, in Great Britain, where law and politics have separate entities.
