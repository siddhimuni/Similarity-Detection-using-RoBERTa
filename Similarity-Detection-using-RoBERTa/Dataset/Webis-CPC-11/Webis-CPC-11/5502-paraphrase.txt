They show different shallow streams of lava as well. One of the most notable of these craters is close to Andernuch, west of the Rhine. The name is Lake of Laach. It is almost two miles in size. Volcanic ejections that look like the ones on Mount Vesusius are found along the margin. Notwithstanding the evidence that the volcanoes of Eyfel that don't were active since the country has received its current form, the records of the operations are not anywhere. We do have a passage in Tacitus which talks about the fires that erupted from the earth close to Cologne; but this does not allow the conclusion that whatever he talks about was an eruption of a volcano. The Drachenfels on the eastern bank of the Rhine and other neighboring mountains, belong to older volcanic forms. We could say the same about the other mountains in Germany and central Europe in general, where rocks from volcanoes are found.

There are quite a bit of traces of volcanoes in Italy, besides the Phlegraean field volcanoes already talked about. The general character of those are identical to the ones that were mentioned before. The main locations are some lakes close to Volterra in Tuscany. They give extremely hot sulphor and boracic acid vapours; a small lake of sulphor close to Viterbo constantly giving off gas bubbles; the Lake of Vico between Viterbo and Rome; Mount Vultur in the Apennines, in the Bascilicata province; and Lake Agnano near Naples. Out of all of these, the most interesting lakes are the ones of Vico and Agnano. The former is the ancient Lacus Cimini, and older authors say that the site was once used for a town. The ruins were visible at the bottom of the lake under clear water for a time. They said the ground was consumed by an eruption when the town was still there. As a result, a lake was formed in its place.
