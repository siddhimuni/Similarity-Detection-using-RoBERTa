For the stove bolts making holes through thin rubber,to make them sufficiently large care should be taken to enable the bolt to pass through not touching the rubber,if not the rubber may cling to the bolts,and gas may leak if they are turned in their holes the rubber may turn near the bolts.
under each nut, a rough washer, prevents it from cutting into the back-board.To introduse air or to remove it,the pad,a three-eights of an inch lock nut
nipple is introduced through the back-board,the thin paper covaring and shellacked paper.A T connects with the nipple without a back-board.one of its branches leads, by a rubber tube,to the pressure gauge,which is a U-tube of glass consists mercury.An ordinary plug clock is upon the other branch,and,beyond this,in a glass mouth-piece a rubber tube is terminating.When it is desired to inflate the air-cusion,it is only need to blow into
mouth piece.For any work that i have undertaken pressure of one inch of mercury is enough.  A lower pressure, is enough particularly with a good paper.
A piece of common cotton flannel with the nap outward upon the top of the pad is laid,and its edges tacked along the under edge of the back-board.
Across the top of the pad the cotton flanel is not drawn tight.The reason for employing a cotton flannel covering is this:To the strong sunlight the sheet rubber has been exposed for few days,it becomes worthless and loses its strength.Protection
against the destruction of the rubber by sunlight 
is given by cotton flannel.I first observed this distruction while experimenting with convenient and 
cheap  type of gauge.I used an ordinary toy balloon
,inexpensive gauge,and i could tell,with sufficient
accuracy, how much pressure i had applied,by sweling of the balloon.This balloon ruptured for unknown reason,and i made a substitute for it out of a round sheet of thin flat rubber,gathered all around the circumference.Passing a string in and out
drew it tight upon the outside of a piece of three
eights of an inch pipe through holes about one-quarter of inch apart made by me,I then wonded
a string tightly over the rubber,on the pipe,and found the whole to be air-tight.This served me for some time,on appling pressure,one day i found a hole in the balloon which looked as if it had been
cut with a very sharp knife.We cant imagine that it has been cut like that,fracture had occured at a line which seperated a surface in the strong sunlight from surface in the shade,at a fold in the rubber, I found that on further examination.I saw that change in colour and had become whiter than before of rubber is due to continous
exposure to intense sunlight,and that the portion
 of the balloon had lost its strength.I then returned the use of mercury guage,and took the precaution to grow cover my pad with cotton flannel,
as to protect from the light and from other sources
of destruction.Upon roof of the institute consists 
this pad;and exposed to all weathers.The whole is covered again with a rubber blanket,as a protection
from the rain and snow.
