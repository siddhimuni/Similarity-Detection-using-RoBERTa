The composing room took up the rest of this floor in the center building and the entirety of the same floor in the adjacent southern building.

Near Mr Ballantyne's room, a door space was cut in the wall of the north building.  Three steps down past the door lay the area for the Morning News's editorial staff.

The front end of this area was divided into three rooms, 7 by 12 feet each in size.  One room was for the use of Field, while the organization's drama critic and solitary artist took up another.  Morgan Bates the exchange editor took the middle room between the former two.

The city staff took up the remaining space on the floor.

In the composing room, the telegraph editor was given an alloted space for his own use.  Unforunately given the circumstances at the time, the danger of a fire breaking out especially during the hours of 10PM would have had fatal consequences for the career and lives of Eugene Field and those of the rest of the Morning News's employees.

Field's was the only room which had an inkling of decoration of all the three previously mentioned.

His room had brown tobacco juice stains on the floor and even on parts of the walls.  Field also stored his clippings related to people of public interest alphabetically in a curious cupboard-shaped pidgeon-file that took up one corner of his room.

Various athletic equipment such as dumbbells, Indian clubs and the like were scattered on the floor of his room.  Although he never made use this equipment, he gave the janitor specific instructions to not touch or move them, or otherwise organize them.
