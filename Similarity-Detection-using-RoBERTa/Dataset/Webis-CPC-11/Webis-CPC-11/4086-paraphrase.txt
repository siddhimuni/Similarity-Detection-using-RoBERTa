Gentlemen, - As chairman of the Committee of arrangements, I was invited to convene this meeting to order. This is usually the case that when a mass meeting of citizens to be held, much labor must be performed to prepare and organize the meeting. But I am glad to say that on this occasion, important advantage of having an audience almost entirely in our favor was enjoyed by the committee. We found a strong and smart and deep almost unanimous feeling throughout the community, with the city government for taking prompt and favorable action on the report of park commissioners. Applause [.] Found serious and enthusiastic community, seeking as a system of parks should be designed to Boston to ensure health, and make some positive and prosperity of our citizens in the future. Committee had only to call this press address through which some of you have read, to find him one hundred ready to Indore, and authorities had only to open doors to get Faneuil Hall crowd here, as they have to night, to express feelings that they feel so general.
