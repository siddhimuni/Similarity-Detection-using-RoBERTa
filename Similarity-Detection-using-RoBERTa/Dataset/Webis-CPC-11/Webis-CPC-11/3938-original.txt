"It is so hard, mademoiselle, when one speaks these things in a strange tongue.  Permit me
to explain that which has arrived.  We encountered a picket, and surprised it.  Having secured
some weapons and accouterments, we hastened to the quay, where was moored the little steamship.
Unhappily, she was crowded with soldiers.  They fired, and there was a short fight.  I was
knocked down, and, what do you call it?--Ã©tourdi--while one might count ten.  I rose, half
blinded, and what do I see?  The vessel leaving the quay--full of men engaged in combat, while,
just beyond the point, a warship is signaling her arrival.  It was a Brazilian warship, mademoiselle.
She showed two red rockets followed by a white one.  It was only a matter of minutes before
she met the little steamship.  I tell you that it was bad luck, that--a vile blow.  I was angry,
yes.  I stamp my foot and say foolish things.  Then I run!"

Iris made no reply.  She hid her face in her hands.  She could frame no more questions.  San
Benavides was trying to tell her that Hozier and the rest had been overwhelmed by fate at the
very instant escape seemed to be within reach.  The Brazilian, probably because of difficulties
that beset him in using a foreign language, did not make it clear that he had flung himself
flat in the dust when he heard the order to fire given by someone on board the launch.  He
said nothing of a tragic incident wherein Marcel, shot through the lungs, fell over him, and
he, San Benavides, mistaking the convict for an assailant, wrestled furiously with a dying
man.  He even forgot to state that had he charged home with the others, he would either have
met a bullet or gained the deck of the launch, and that his failure to reach the vessel was
due to his own careful self-respect.  For San Benavides was not a coward.  He could be brave
spectacularly, but he had no stomach for a fight in the dark, when stark hazard chooses some
to triumph and some to die.
