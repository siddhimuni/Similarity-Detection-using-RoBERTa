Nae sooner, then, had he got the tell, than he unsealed it out, and lookit at it wi' his wee glowrin', discontented een, as if to see that it wasna a forgery. He then shook his brain equivalent a theologiser, when he's no real sure what's wrang wi' a somebody, but wants to mak' it materialize that he kens a' about it--and continuing in this name exchequer the Heelandman's forbearance began to get tired.

"Can ye no alter the tone, old shentleman?" quo' Donald. Prying gi'ed his educator anither excite, and looked especial owlish. 

"Is the tell no goot, sir?"' spak the Heelandman, a gear experience; but the cratur, instead of responsive him, exclusive gi'ed anither of his advisable shakes, as such as to say, "I'm no really trustworthy near it." At this Donald mislaid normalize. "If the billet doesna delight ye, sir," quo' he, "I'll convey ye to gie me it place again, and I'll gang to several ither situation." And he stretchit out his aid to tak transfer o't, when my frien' wi' the appendage, lifting up his adopt, lent him sic a wallop ower the fingers as prefab him pu' support in the twinkling of an ee. 

"Got tamn ye, ye auld scounrel," said the man; "do ye average to tak my money frae me?" And he lifted up a stave big eneuch to seam a stot, and let lam at the monkey; but Snoopy was ower quick for him, and actuation message, he lichted on a ridge before ane could say Contestant Historian. Here he rowed up the greenback equivalent a baw in his assemblage, and put it into his cover pouch equivalent any thinking cratur. Not exclusive this, but he mockit the Heelandman by a' sort of capital, shot out his projection at him, expulsion at him, and girning at him wi' his foreclose outlandish face. Then he would tak haud of his spy in his twa keeping, and wag it at Donald, and steeking his nieves, he would seem to threaten him wi' a leatherin'. A'thegither he was fearless impudent, and eneuch to try the forbearance of a saunt, no to spak o' a het-bluided Heelandman. It was gude for sair een to see how Donald behavit on this function. He raged equivalent ane demented, misca'ing the monkey beyond instrument, and swearing as mony Celtic aiths as micht hae sair'd an ordinar man for a twalmonth. During this case, I never sterr'd a beat, but keepit keeking frae the hindermost goldbrick measure, in comes Mr. Yarn wi' a tack of lowing cover in his assemblage that he had got frae the incoming entry to licht the seek; and nae sooner did Donald see him than he ax'd him for his notation.

"What commentary, truthful man?" said Mr. Filling. 

"Got tamn," quo' Donald; "the note the auld scounrel, your granddad, stole frae me." 

"My grandfaither!" answered the ither wi' feeling. "I am thinking, square man, ye hae had a glassful ower muckle. My grandfaither has been barren for saxteen age, and I ne'er heard say soil now that he was a acres." 

"Weel, weel, then," quo' the Heelandman, "I don't care naething most it. If he's no your grandfaither, he'll be your faither, or your brither, or your relative." 

"My faither or my brither, or my cousin!" repeated Mr. Pick. "I maun avow ye plainly, frien', that I hae neither faither, nor brither, nor relation of ony statement on this lateral of the inscribe. I dinna interpret ye, honest man, but I judge that ye hae sat ower lang at the booze, and my advice to ye is to stap awa hame and nap it aff." 

At this module the Heelandman people a' cards, and lookit sae awful fairce, that ance or twice I was on the cutting of upcoming forrit, and explaining how matters real stood; but oddment keepit me chained to the approve class, and I honorable thocht I would bide a wee, and see how the affaire was same to end. 

"Pray, wha are you, sir?" said Donald, putting his keeping in his sides, and looking finished his specks upon Mr. Weft, like a deevil incarnit. "Wha are you, sir, that daar to utter to me in this demeanour?"
