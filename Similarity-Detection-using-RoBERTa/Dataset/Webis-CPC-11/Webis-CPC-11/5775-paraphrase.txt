Her origin, like most, is obscure; but Clara possesses talents, and generosity that is disproportionate to that of her family. Clara is plump and well-shaped, but short, with a fine dark eye and raven locks that give her an interesting countenance. For a few years she had a liking for the stage, and played minor theaters, under the lame "The Lady;" a character Clara can, when she desires, support with unusual cheerfulness.
