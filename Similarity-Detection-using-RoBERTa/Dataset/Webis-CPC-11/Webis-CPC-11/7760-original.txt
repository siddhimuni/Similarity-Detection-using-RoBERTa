The privilege
it has pleased Almighty God to give to some of our witnesses, ought not to be lightly communicated
and made cheap.  I have my ears battered with a thousand such tales as these: "Three persons
saw him such a day in the east three, the next day in the west: at such an hour, in such a
place, and in such habit"; assuredly I should not believe it myself.  How much more natural
and likely do I find it that two men should lie than that one man in twelve hours' time should
fly with the wind from east to west?  How much more natural that our understanding should be
carried from its place by the volubility of our disordered minds, than that one of us should
be carried by a strange spirit upon a broomstaff, flesh and bones as we are, up the shaft of
a chimney?  Let not us seek illusions from without and unknown, we who are perpetually agitated
with illusions domestic and our own.  Methinks one is pardonable in disbelieving a miracle,
at least, at all events where one can elude its verification as such, by means not miraculous;
and I am of St. Augustine's opinion, that, "'tis better to lean towards doubt than assurance,
in things hard to prove and dangerous to believe."

'Tis now some years ago that I travelled through the territories of a sovereign prince, who,
in my favour, and to abate my incredulity, did me the honour to let me see, in his own presence,
and in a private place, ten or twelve prisoners of this kind, and amongst others, an old woman,
a real witch in foulness and deformity, who long had been famous in that profession.
