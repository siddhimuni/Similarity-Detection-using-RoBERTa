"It is next door to impossible that an American gentleman should do such a thing; but if he did, I should consider that he had reduced himself to the level of a snob, and should treat him as I would any snob in the streets,--knock him down, if I was able; and if I wasn't, take the law of him: and if a man had wronged me irreparably, I fancy I should do as these uncivilized Southerners themselves do in such a case,--shoot him down in the street, wherever I could catch him. 

 What sense or justice is there in a duel? It is as if a man stole your coat, and instead of having him put into prison, you drew lots with him whether you or he should go." 

 "But suppose a man was spreading false reports about you; suppose he said you were no gentleman, or that you had cheated somebody?" 

 "Bah!" replied Benson, dexterously evading the most important part of the question, "if I were to fight all the people that spread false reports about me, I should have my hands full. 

 There is a man in this room that slandered me as grossly as he could four years ago, and was very near breaking off my marriage. 

 That fat man there, with all the jewelry--Storey Hunter." 

 "Indeed!" exclaimed the other, really surprised, for he had just seen Mrs. Benson conversing with the ponderous exquisite, apparently on most amicable terms. 

 "Yes, and it was entirely gratuitous. I never gave the scamp any provocation. By Jupiter!" Benson turned very white and then very red, "if he isn't dancing with my wife! His impudence is too much, and----. I believe one of our women would put up with any thing from a man here if he can only dance well. They have no self-respect."
