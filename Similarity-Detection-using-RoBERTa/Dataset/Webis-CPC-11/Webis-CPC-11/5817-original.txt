That was by no means merely the private opinion of the individual topographer but
the opinion of the age; for each century has not only its own peculiar theory of life--it has
also its own peculiar theory o£ natural scenery.

Numberless country-seats were built a hundred years ago in barren tedious plains, and the builders
thought that by so doing they had chosen the most beautiful situation imaginable; whereas the
old baronial castles, in the most charming mountainous regions, were allowed to decay and go
to ruin because they were not situated "delectably enough." The Bavarian Electors at that time
not only laid out splendid summer residences and state gardens in the dreary woody and marshy
plains of Nymphenburg and Schleissheim, but Max Emanuel even went so far as to have another
artificial desert expressly constructed in the middle of one of these gardens--whose walls
are already surrounded by the natural desert. Karl Theodor of the Palatinate built his Schwetzinger
garden two hours away from the magnificent dales of Heidelberg, in the midst of the most monotonous
kind of plain. Only let a region be fairly level and treeless, and immediately men were bold
enough to imagine that it would be possible to conjure up there, the most delightful of landscapes.

Even fifty years ago the upper Rhine valley--which is by no means without charm but is nevertheless
monotonous in its flatness--was considered a real paradise of natural scenic beauty, while
the middle course of the river from Ruedesheim to Coblenz, with its rich splendor of gorges,
rocks, castles and forests, was appreciated rather by way of contrast. In the upper Rheingau
at that time they strung out one villa after another; these are now for the most part deserted,
while on the formerly neglected tracts of country confined between the mountains a new summer
castle is being stuck again on the summit of every rock, or at least the ruins already, hanging
there are being made habitable once more. Our fathers, who thought the upper Rheingau the most
beautiful corner of Germany, decorated their rooms with engravings so much in vogue at that
time, similar to Claude Lorraine's broad, open landscapes of far reaching perspective filled
with peace and charm. From this classical ideal of landscape we have come back again to the
romantic, and the cupolas of the high mountains have supplanted the leafy temples of Claude's
sacred groves with their background of the infinite sea sparkling in the sunshine.

In the seventeenth century the watering-places situated in the narrow, steep mountain valleys--many
of which have now fallen into decay--were considered, for the greater part, the most frequented
and most beautiful; in the eighteenth century the preference was given to those lying more
toward the plain; while in our day the watering-places in the steepest mountains, as in the
Black Forest, the Bohemian Mountains, and the Alps, are being sought out on account of their
situation. The court physician of Hesse-Cassel, Weleker, in his description of Schlangenbad,
which appeared in 1721, describes the place as situated in a dreary, desolate, forbidding region,
in which nothing grows but "leaves and grass," but he adds that by ingeniously planting straight
rows and circles of trees carefully pruned with the shears they had at least imparted to the
spot some sort of artistic raison d'être. Today, on the contrary, Schlangenbad is considered
one of the mast beautifully situated baths in Germany; the "dreariness" and "desolation" we
now call romantic and picturesque, and the fact that in this spot nothing grows but "grass
and leaves"--that is to say, that the fragrant meadow-land starts right before the door, and
that the green boughs of the forest peep in everywhere at the windows--this perhaps attracts
as many guests at present as the efficacy of the mineral spring.

The artists of the Middle Ages thought that they could give no more beautiful background to
their historical paintings and half-length portraits than by introducing mountains and rocks
of as fantastic and jagged a form as possible, although the latter often contrast strangely
enough beside a mild, calmly serene Madonna face, or even beside the likeness of a prosaically
respectable commonplace citizen of some free Imperial town. At that time, therefore, savagely
broken-up, barren mountain scenery was considered the ideal type of natural scenic beauty,
while, a few centuries later, such forms were found much too unpolished and irregular to be
considered beautiful at all. Even old historical painters of the Netherlands, who had perhaps
never in their lives seen such deeply fissured masses of rock, liked to make use of them in
their backgrounds.
