National Finances in 1861.

Other than from the ordinary revenues under preceding statutes, the first receipts into the Treasury in 1861 came from the loan of February 5, which authorized the issue of bonds bearing six percent interest payable within 10 and 20 years. The authorized amount was $25,000,000, and the secretary was able to negotiate $18,415,000 at the average rate or 89.03%.

On 4th March 1861, the Congress closed its session, and among its final acts provided a loan of $10,000,000 in bonds, or the issue of a similar sum in Treasury notes. The President was also empowered to issue Treasury notes for any part of the previously authorized loans. Under this statute, notes were issued to the amount of $12,896,350 payable sixty days after date and $22,468,100 payable after two years. This measure indicated the means to provide for pressing emergencies in the short term, and left heavier responsibilities for the long term. An incident during this period was the settlement of the debt incurring in the war with the Indians, by giving the claiments (or representatives) 6% bonds redeemable in twenty years. These bonds were taken to the amount of $1,090,850, showing that such securities were welcome to claimants even at per.

The United states has always depended on customs as its primary source of revenue. But there had not been any real test of the sum that might be collected from this source. It was intended to see how small an amount would be needed to support the National Government, not how large an amount could be collected. It wa now time when this critical experiement was to be tried and the first step was the Morrill Tariff, which went into effect on April 1st. It altered radically the policy for customs duties from the legislations of 1846 and 1857, and made the national self-supporting in manufacture. Although it was brought in before secession attained threatening proportions, it was well adapted to the condition in which the country was placed at the time of enactment. It was a measure carefully elaborated and studious accuracy was applied to the principles it was based on. Under it the imposts, which had averaged about 19% on articles with duty applied and 15% of the total imports changed to 36% on dutiable items and 28% of the total imports. Even though the import of goods fell off during the war and the difficulties encountered by rebel privateers, the customs duties increased rather than decreased and credit was thus secured for the immense loans that became necessary. Mr Sherman, or Ohio, stated that this measure would produce an income of $65,000,000 per annum to the Treasury.

The Morril Tariff was such a success that when Congress came together in response to the call from President Lincoln, Mr Thaddeus Stevens, as head of the committee charged with this subject, informed the house that it had been determined not to enter upon a general revision. He reported a measure to extend the schedule of dutiable articles with the aim of adding Â£22,250,000 to the annual revenue immediately. After some disagreement in the Senate, his bill was amended slightly and enacted on August 5th 1861. On December 24th 1861, the duties on tea, coffee and sugar were increased directly as a war measure. When considering this bill, Mr Morrill estimated that the revenue would increase by about $7,000,000 and Mr Vallandigham or Ohio too exception to the diminished imports and asked "How are you to have revenue from imports when nothing is imported? Your expenditures are $500,000,000 and your income but $50,000,000." He was much more accurate that is usual for political retoric, and Mr Morrill's response was to hope that the gentleman from Ohio was able to offer some more acceptable proposition. The bill was indeed a reasonable and effective measure and Mr Vallandigham had no alternative to office.

On 4th December 1860, in his annual report as Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb estimated that receipts for the treasury for the fiscal year ending June 1862 would amount to $64,495,891 while he estimated expenditures as $68,363,726. With the prospect of peace and national unity he predicted a deficiency of $3,867,834 for that year.
