THE FIRST JURY COULD NOT AGREE TO THE VERDICT,THE SECOND JURY IS THE ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO STANDING OUT AGAINST CONVICTION THE SECOND  TYPE OF JURY CONDEMNED THE MAN IT MADE AN EFFORT TO PROCURE COMMUTATION OF HIS SENTENCE GOT FAILED,ATLAST HE WAS LEFT FOR AN EXECUTION.THE EXECUTION WAS IN THE PLACE OF SEERY SOLEMNLY DENIED HIS GUILT.AT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PUBLIC FEELED OVER MORE.IT WAS A MORNING TIME IT WAS SO CALM AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A SOUND OF BUGLES AND PEELING OF DRUMS WERE HEARD IN ALL THE DIRECTIONS.THERE WAS A PERFECT CESSATION OF BUSINESS IN THE TOWN.ABOUT 10'O' CLOCK ALL  THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WAS GONE TO SHUT DOWN NO WAS WAS THERE AROUND THE STREET ON THAT TIME.THUS THE PEOPLE DETERMINED TO HAVE TO MARK THEIR OPINION ON THE AWFUL TRAGEDY FOR ALL REGARD SEERY AS A MARTYR.AND AT 11'O'CLOCK THE MILITARY WERE PARADED BEFORE THE GAOL, AND NOT ONE HUMAN BEING APPEARED BEFORE THE SCAFFOLD BUT THEMSELVES AND THE POLICE. EVEN THE MAGISTRATES OF THE COUNTY STAYED AWAY--NOT ONE OF THEM APPEARED, EXCEPT MR. UNIACKE, WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN WITH CAPTAIN DESPARD. UNDER THE IMPOSING HEAD OF THE 'MULLINGAR TRAGEDY,' THE REPORTER OF THE DUBLIN FREEMAN FURNISHES THAT JOURNAL WITH A LONG AND HIGHLY-COLOURED ACCOUNT OF THE INTERMENT OF BRYAN SEERY. THE MELANCHOLY SPECTACLE TOOK PLACE ON SUNDAY, IN THE PRESENCE OF VAST MULTITUDES OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE, WHOSE NUMBERS WERE ESTIMATED BY THE WRITER TO AMOUNT TO FIFTY THOUSAND OR SIXTY THOUSAND SOULS." 
ON OTHER OCCASIONS THE POPULACE ATTENDED THE EXECUTION OF CRIMINALS IN LARGE NUMBERS, AND EXHIBITED THEIR SYMPATHY BY DEMONSTRATIONS OF RESPECT AND OF REGRET FOR THEIR FATE, SPEAKING OF THEM AS "THE BLESSED MARTYRS" FOR THEIR RELIGION, OR THEIR COUNTRY, OR BOTH. AN EXECUTION TOOK PLACE AT NENAGH, IN THE COUNTY OF TIPPERARY, EARLY IN JUNE, WHICH WAS THUS NOTICED IN A PAPER, NEITHER UNFAVOURABLE TO THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE, NOR THE EXERCISE OF THE UTMOST CLEMENCY ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWARDS THE MISGUIDED:--"THREE MEN WERE EXECUTED AT NENAGH ON FRIDAY (LAST WEEK), PURSUANT TO THEIR SENTENCES; TWO--NAMELY, PATRICK HAYES AND PATRICK RICE--FOR CONSPIRING TO MURDER THE LATE MR. PATRICK CLARKE; AND ONE, NAMED WILLIAM FOGARTY--FOR SHOOTING AT MR. M'DONALD, A STEWARD IN THE SLATE QUARRIES. AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE COLLECTED TO WITNESS THE SCENE. THE THREE MEN WERE ACCOMPANIED TO THE DROP BY ROMAN CATHOLIC CLERGYMEN. THEY DIED AFTER A BRIEF STRUGGLE, HAVING MADE NO PUBLIC CONFESSION OF THEIR CRIMES. A LARGE POLICE FORCE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN, AND A COMPANY OF THE 72ND DEPOT, COMPRISED THE GUARD IN ATTENDANCE. ALL WAS QUIET AND PEACEABLE, SAYS A LOCAL PAPER, AND NOTHING HEARD BUT THE MOANINGS OF THE FRIENDS OF THE CULPRITS. AFTER THE USUAL TIME OF HANGING, THE BODIES WERE LOWERED INTO COFFINS, AND GIVEN TO THE RELATIONS. THE LONG RESPITE OBTAINED BY THESE MEN WHILST VARIOUS POINTS OF LAW WERE URGED IN THEIR FAVOUR, GAVE MUCH ADDITIONAL INTEREST TO THEIR CASES." 
EXECUTIONS DID NOT, HOWEVER, EXTINGUISH THE PREVALENCE OF CRIME, NOR WERE THE PRECAUTIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE SUFFICIENT TO WREST THE WEAPON FROM THE MURDEROUS HAND. A GALWAY PAPER, IN "THE LIBERAL INTEREST," RECORDED A MURDER NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THAT COUNTY WITH THE COUNTY OF CLARE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXECUTION AT NENAGH, AND VARIOUS OTHERS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
