But when Guilthdacus became victorious, suddenly a tempest arose which scattered the Danish fleet and put the king in danger of being lost.  Finally, five days later, the wind carried Guilthdacus to Northumberland along with a few ships.

Beline was in Northumberland providing for defense against his brother.  When he learned of the king of Denmark's arrival, he stayed.  Brenne recovered and outfitted his ships and sent word to his brother Beline to restore him to his wife who had been raped by Guilthadacus and also to return his lands to him.  Beline denied these reqeusts.  Breene quickly traveled toward Albania wtih his army.  Breene there found his brother Beline near a wood named Slaater.  After a cruel fight and mortal battle, the Britains were victorious.  After the battle, most of the Norwegians were wounded, slain and left for dead on the ground.

After Beline vanquished his brother and was the sole possessor of the lands of Britaine, he confirmed the laws his father had made and to complete the highways his father had begun.  He called the workmen to pave the ways with stone to ease passage for all who traveled through the countries from place to place.

The first highway was named Fosse and it stretche from south to north, beginning at the corner of Totness in Cornwall and passing by Devonshire, Somersetshire, tutherie, Cotswald, Coventry, Leicester, Newark and ending in the city of Lincoln.  The second highway was named Watling Street and stretched from southeast to northwest, beginning at Douer and passing Kent over Thames, London, Westminster, St. Alban's, Dunstable, Stratford, Toucester, Wedon, Lilleborne, Atherston, Gilberts hill (which is now called Wreken), Seuerne, Worcester, Stratton, and to the middle of Wales and on to Cardigan at the Irish Sea.  The third highway was named Erming Street and it stretched form west northwest to east southeast, beginning at Meneuia in St. David's in West Wales to Southampton.
