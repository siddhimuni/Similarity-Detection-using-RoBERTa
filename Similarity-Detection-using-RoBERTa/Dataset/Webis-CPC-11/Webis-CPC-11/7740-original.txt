Its first progress is, most generally, by extending to the edges of the gums round other teeth;
frequently affecting a large portion of the dental arches. A very early progress is, however,
mostly effected, down the length of the tooth, in the direction of the socket; and, in this
way, the disease commits great and unsuspected ravages. When it reaches the edges of the bony
socket, the tooth begins to be loose, and when drawn, exhibits portions of the fang, including
parts which had been contained within the alveolus, entirely denuded of their periosteum. Indeed,
from observation, I should say, that the latter membrane was the part, which was the most peculiarly
liable to injury and death from this disease; and it is by no means clear, to my apprehension,
that this is not frequently the commencement of the complaint. The injury generally proceeds
with augmenting rapidity; especially when it has affected the deeper parts: and it is while
in the act of rapidly spreading, that it occasions gangrene.

In the production of gangrenous sloughs, it much resembles the descriptions usually given of
sloughing ulcers. A portion of the parts immediately subjacent to the ulcer loses its life;
this rapidly separates; and, before or after a complete removal, a fresh slough is formed in
the same manner. The sloughs are generally black, with ash-coloured edges. I have not been
able to discern a change of colour, the production of vesicles, or any material tumefaction,
as antecedent to the gangrene. There is generally, by this time, an increased heat in the parts;
with the sensation termed "calor mordens."
