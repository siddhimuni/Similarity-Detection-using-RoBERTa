Meanwhile, Clo had answered the knock and revealed Johnson. 

"Madam, the lady who came with Mr. Sands want to meet u immediately; from the background she announce it's very urgent.

"Say I'll be there in a few minutes," she replied. "I can't come just yet." 

Johnson departed. "Madam will come in a few minutes," Miss Blackburne, who had been anxiously awaiting him at a half-open door. "I think," he added, "she is busy, miss."

"Something must be worrying Miss Blackburne," she said. "I wonder if it's anything you'd like Mr. Sands to mix up in, or if you'd rather attend to it yourself? You know, we've lots of time before ten o'clock. If the papers are in this envelope, it's all right. If not, there's nothing doing." 

Just why Beverley did not want Roger to go to her boudoir she hardly knew, unless she feared that a pearl might be missing, and that Roger would be more vexed than he was already. Whatever the motive in her mind, she felt suddenly impelled to haste. Even with Clo she could not leave the envelope.

"You sent for me, Miss Blackburne?" she asked, as she threw open the door. 

The pearl-stringer stood by the table, looking pale and strange. 

"Oh, Mrs. Sands," she exclaimed, "you told me the pearls were in their case, but they're not. I found it empty. 

Beverley wondered whether she had become temporarily insane, and had hidden the pearls in a place already forgotten.

"No," she said, answering herself as well as Miss Blackburne, "I didn't touch the pearls after I put them away, and brought them in here. Oh, please don't tease me! This is too serious!" 

"No--no!" exclaimed Beverley, calmed by the other's distress. "Of course I believe nothing so foolish. Even if you--what nonsense to speak of it!--but even if you wanted the pearls, you couldn't hide them. Let me think! Let me go back in my mind over everything that happened. I was in the next room practically all the time when I wasn't here. 

"What about our little friend, Clo Riley?" Miss Blackburne asked. "Could she possibly know anything? Mightn't she help with some suggestion?

Beverley forgot to answer. The pearl-stringer's words had sent her thoughts travelling along a new path. Suddenly she became aware that she had deceived Miss Blackburne and herself. When she made that statement, she had not reflected. Clo's return, in O'Reilly's company, now seemed so long ago that she had not cast her mind back so far in connection with the pearls. She had thought of what she had done since O'Reilly's refusal of her request, and his departure.

"I'll speak to Clo," she finally replied "Please stay here. I'll be back in three or four minutes, and bring Clo with me, if she's well enough."

Her nerves were throbbing like hot wires, and she jumped at the opening of the door. 

"Oh, I'm glad it's you!" she sighed, at sight of Beverley. "Have you opened the envelope?" 

"The envelope!" Beverley repeated. "Oh, Clo, I thought nothing on earth could have put it out of my head for a second.
