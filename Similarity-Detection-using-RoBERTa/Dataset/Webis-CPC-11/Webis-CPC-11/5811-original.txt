He listened to every voice, examined every form that passed him in rapid succession;
yet he felt himself alone, and determined not to be led away by sounds such as had already
occupied his attention, but rather to look about him, and notice the eccentricities with which
he was surrounded. Sauntering along in this mood, he was presently assailed by a voice behind
him, exclaiming, "Bob--

          "Bob, if you wish to go safely on,
          Tarn round about, and look out for the Don."

Upon hearing this, he turned hastily around, and encountered a group of Chimney-sweepers, who
immediately set up such a clatter with their brushes and shovels, dancing at the same time
in the true May-day style round him and a strapping Irish fish-woman, that he was completely
prevented from pursuit, and almost from observation, while a universal laugh from those near
him bespoke the mirth his situation excited; and the Hibernian damsel, with true Irish sympathy,
attempted to allay his chagrin by clasping him in her brawny arms, and imprinting on his ruddy
cheek a kiss. This only served to heighten their merriment and increase his embarrassment,
particularly as his Cher ami swore she had not had a buss like it since the death of her own
dear dead and departed Phelim, the last of her four husbands, who died of a whiskey fever,
bawling for pratees and buttermilk, and was waked in a coal-shed.

This mark of the Lady's favour was not so favourably received by Tallyho, and, determined to
make his escape, he gave Moll a violent fling from him, overturned her and her basket, knock'd
down two of the Chimney-sweepers, and then with a leap as if he had been springing at a five-barred
gate, jumped over his late companion, who lay sprawling among the flue-fakers, and effected
his purpose, to the inexpressible amusement of those, who, after enjoying a hearty laugh at
him, now transferred their risibility to those he left behind. Finding himself once more unshackled,
he smack'd his whip with enthusiasm, and repeated his Tallyho with increased effect; for it
was immediately answered, and, without waiting for its final close, he found the person from
whom it was ~409~~ proceeding to be no other than a Turk, who was precipitately entering one
of the rooms, and was as quickly recognized by him to be the Hon. Tom Dashall. The alteration
which a Turkish turban and pelisse had effected in his person, would however have operated
as an effectual bar to this discovery, had he not seized him in the very moment of vociferation;
and although his Cousin had been the chief cause of the adventures he had already met with,
he had at the same time kept an eye upon Bob, and been equally instrumental in effecting his
release from embarrassment.

"Come," said Tom, "I am for a little gig in the Room--how long have you been here?--I thought
I should find you out, very few can disguise themselves from me; we will now be spectators
for half an hour, and enjoy the mirth excited by others."

"With all my heart," rejoined Bob, "for I am almost as tired already as if I had spent a whole
day in a fox-chase, and have run as many risks of my neck; so that a cool half hour's observation
will be very acceptable."

They had scarcely entered the Room, as a Priscilla Tomboy passed them at full speed with a
skipping-rope, for whose accommodation every one made way; and who, having skipped round the
room to shew her fine formed ancle and flexibility of limbs, left it for a moment, and returned
with a large doll, which she appeared as pleased with as a child of eight or ten years of age.
A Jemmy Jumps assured Tom, that his garments were altogether unsuitable to the nation in which
he was residing, and recommended that he should not exist another day without that now very
fashionable appendage of a Gentleman's dress called stays--An excellent Caleb Quotem, by his
smartness of repartee and unceasing volubility of speech in recounting his labours of a day--"a
summer's day," as the poet says, afforded much amusement by his powers of out-talking the fribble
of a Staymaker, who, finding himself confused by his eternal clack, fled in search of another
customer.
