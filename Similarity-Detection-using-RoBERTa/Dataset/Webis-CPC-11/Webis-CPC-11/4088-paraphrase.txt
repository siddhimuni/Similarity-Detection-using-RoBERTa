They do not delay, they bring the royal maiden from that stream, they have her in her brother's room for her crime and some pagans believe those tombs were prepared. There is a rumor that Patrick from Ardmachia, whom is believed to bring people back from the dead, arrived in the city that day. After the king heard this he was happy since he wanted his two children back, so he promised to have all of his followers worship the gods if he could be blessed. All of the elite followers went along with the king to try to bring the children back. The saint gave out his prayers due to everyone doing what he asked, and thus the children came back. There was the king Alphinus, his son Cochadh, and daughter Dublinia, who was from a city named after her. Everyone rejected the abominations as being from the devil converted unto Christ, and thus baptized them at Saint Patrick's fountain, found in the southern part of the city, where the earth had been striked by the staff of Jesus to increase believers. This continues to this day from tis sacrifice in order to revere Saint Patrick and the primates of Ardmachia. King Alphinus and all the citizens of Dublinia them promised all prosperty to Saint Patrick and those primates of Ardmachia, and thus built a church near the fountain and another near the Church of Holy Trinity, and another in the west near archibishop's palace.
