There was a great opposition even in the fourth century. Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Corinth, Ephesus, and other cities numbered many Christians in the third century. The great centres of trade also had many powerful churches. In those, people of all nations came together. However, they were subject of bitter persecutions, even in those buildings where they came together to worship Jehovah. Because of that, for two hundred years they worshipped Him secretly, in secluded locations. Christians did not make up a great percentage in the whole population. Even more they were from the poorest classes. In the first century there were not called many wise or noble. We have not found any great names between them. There were no philosophers, or statesmen, or nobles, or generals, or governors, or judges, or magistrates. In the first century the Christians were too weak to be persecuted by the government. They had not attracted attention. Not even Illyrian philosophers wrote against them. Even Christians did not write aplogies themselves. There is no writing from any known historian at that time. In the cities Christians used to make up mostly artisans, slaves, servants, or mechanics. In the country, on the other hand, they were peasants. The were unimportant, plebeian, unlettered. We have not been handed down any distinguished converts except as persecutors, or as great contemporaries. We have read about the prosecutions of the Jews, of Herod Agrippa, of Philo, of Nero but not of the Christians. Eusebius does not write a well-known Christian in  the first century.
