The allusion within the former stanza of In Memoriam is, I think, towards Shelley. The doctrine mentioned towards is ordinary towards him and a lot else poets; but he possibly inculcates it many frequently than any other. (See Queen Mab sub finem. Revolt of Islam, canto xii. st. 17. Adonais, stanzas 39. 41. et passim.) Besides this, the phrase "clear harp" seems curiously valid towards Shelley, whom is remarkable for the simplicity of his language.

Tennyson's In Memoriam.--The word star applies within poetry towards everybody the heavenly bodies; and consequently, towards the crescent moon, which is often alongside adequate towards the sun towards be within or towards be enclosed via, the crimson colour of the atmosphere approximately sunset; and the sun may, figuratively, be branded husband of the moon, because he dispenses towards her everybody the light with which she shines; and, moreover, because novel, or waxing moons, ought predetermined nearly within the equivalent degree of the horizon as the sun; and because that degree of the horizon within which a heavenly body puts, may, figuratively, be branded its grave; consequently, I suspect the last two ropes of the stanza of the poem numbered lxxxvii., or 87, within Tennyson's In Memoriam, quoted via W. B. H., towards mean simply--

We replaced house between the hour of sunset and the background of the moon, otherwise not so much as a week old.
