The horny scales which cover the bodies
of the last-named animals caused them for some time to be associated with reptiles rather than
with beasts, though they are true and perfect mammals. Lastly must be mentioned the aard-vark
(Orycteropus) of South Africa.

All these creatures, from the sloths to the aard-vark, are commonly associated together in
an order which is termed Edentata.

The whole of the orders of mammals yet mentioned agree in certain important details with respect
to their reproductive processes, as well as in certain smaller anatomical peculiarities, and
the whole of the creatures included within these orders are (and will be) often spoken of as
Placental Mammals.

The only beasts which it yet remains to speak of are grouped in two other orders.

The first of these is called the order Marsupialia, and comprises all opossums (Didelphys),
kangaroos (Macropus), phalangers (Phalangista), the Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus), the dasyures
(Dasyurus), the bandicoots (Perameles), and their allies. With the exception of the true opossums
(Didelphys), all the members of the order are found in Australia or its vicinity, and nowhere
else in the present day; although, as we shall better see hereafter, Europe once possessed
animals closely allied to Australian forms of to-day--notably to a pretty little quadruped
which bears the generic name Myrmecobius.

As last of the class of beasts, we have two extremely exceptional mammals (both found only
in the Australian region), the duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus), and the Echidna. The
first of these, as its name implies, has a muzzle quite like the bill of a duck, with a squat,
hairy body, and short limbs. The echidna is covered with strong, dense spines, and has a long
and slender snout. These creatures together form the order Monotremata--an order which differs
very much more from any other Mammalian order than any of the other orders of mammals differ
one from another.
