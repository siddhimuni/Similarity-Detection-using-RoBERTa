The important in which such ladies and such socities
were held,not merely in france but in all europe,may
be judged of from the fact,that the breach between Deffant and her young companian was treated in some measure as a public European event.The French minister and forien ambassadors took part in it,and the whole literary world felt in effect.After this breach there were two tone-giving tribunals for the guidance of public opinion in matters of literature and taste,and their decisions were circulated by letter over all Europe.Horace Walpole,Henault,Montesquiqu.Voltaire,whose correspondence with Deffant has been published in the present century,remained true to her cause.D'Alembert,whose correspondence with Deffant,as well as that of the Duchess of Maine,have also been published in our century,went overto L'Espinasse.This academician,whose name and influence was next in importance to that of Voltaire,formed the nucleus of a new society in the house of L'Espinasse,and was grievously tormented by his inamorata,who pursued one plan of conquest after another when she saw one scheme of marrige after another fail of success.It appears from the whole of the transctions and consequences connected with this breach,however surprising it may be,that this formation of a new circle in paris for evening entertainment may be with truth compared to the institution of a new academy for the promotion of European culture and refinement.The Duchess of Luxembourg,who continued to be a firm friend of Deffant,took upon herself to provide suitable apartments for the society,whilst the minister of the day(the Duc de Cchoiseul)prevailed upon the king of grant a pension of no inconsiderable amount to L'Espinasse.

This new circle was the point of union for allthe philosophical reformers.Here D'Alembert and Diderot led the conversation;and the renowed head of the political economists,Turgot,who was afterward minister of state,was a member of this bolder circle of men who become celebrated and ill-renowed under the name of Encyclopaedists.
