A gallery of a similar nature, but of wood, and above which the order was assigned by human beings learn, John Carter, is still remaining in the north-west corner of Westminster Abbey. You and I, who unfortunately are inclined to admire ugliness and antiquity, would have been better pleased with the capitals of columns, which are evidently coeval with the tower. Drawings are made by some of these capitals, and I have chosen two which seems to be more specific.

In this note an angel weighs the good deeds of the deceased by his evil deeds and, as the former are far exceeding the avoirdupois over which Satan is to find his request, he is endeavoring to improper seat his degree with a two-pronged fork.

This parable is a frequent occurrence in the religious legends .-- saint, who was aware of the fraud and heck, resolved to keep his balance .-- He started throwing in a pilgrimage to a beautiful maiden .-- Evil left a meeting with some Madonna just man, who had ceased to be made holy, blameless .-- scale sackcloth and ashes and repented Lenten-time deposit response .-- devil mask and leafy - masker's cloak of Carnival .-- And they are still equally interchanging believer pain with sweets of sin, and yet holy was distressed beyond compare, with respect for the level of spoken (scholars call his principle correction,) always looked serious. He almost desperately to rescue his client when he luckily saw eight black jetty and little claws and clenching down on the edge of the basin of gold. Claws at once betrayed and broken foot craft. Lucifer Lucifer had put a little leery of the new under balance, which, following the dictates of his senior, held in-depth scale, and waving it with all his strength and size. Holy heck sent to its proper place in a moment, and instantly burthen of sin is seen to kick the beam.

Painters and sculptors often introduce this ancient allegory of the balance of good and evil, in their representations of the recent: it was hired by Lucas Kranach.

Other capital, which I send to you is decorated by groups or Sagittaries Centaurs. Astronomical sculptures are often found in monuments of the middle ages. Both cities are part of a series of zodiacal sculptures preserved in the Muse des Fran√ßais Monumens, and, speaking from memory, I think they bear a close similarity in style to what is represented here.

Montivilliers itself is a neat little town, set in a beautiful valley with a stream of water running through it. At this time, his trade was empty, but the case was different in ancient days, when his Cloths are considered to rival those of Flanders and the preservation of production was considered so much consequence, that the rules are different in respect of orders royal. One in particular, the fourteenth century, committed fraud reports from other cities in imitation Montivilliers proper clothes.

The overall appearance is much like Harfleur Montivilliers it, but left many of the walls and gates to show that she was once a greater importance still comparable. Ancient trade of the country is already transferred to Havre de Grace, the state of the city are being much more elegible.

Not mesh on rolls its waves under Harfleur, and desiccated port now seen as a green meadow. Without the help of history, therefore, you will investigate the leak of the name in vain, about which, learned Huet, Bishop of Avranches [39], calls us to remark, that the names of many places in Normandy in late Fleur, as Barfleur, Harfleur, Honfleur, Fiefleur, Vitefleur, & c., and that if, as is often thought, this comes from the suspension fluctus, it must have gone through Saxon, which means language fleoten flow. Thus we have the navy, and navy, fleut and Fleur, the recent change being provided by genius of the French language. Bishop further states that there are two facts afford a crucial test of the origin: one, that the names now stop at Fleur ended anciently fleet, Barfleur Barbeflot yes, Hareflot Harfleur and Honfleur Huneflot, other, all countries are called where they are washed by the tide. Such is the position of cities in the Netherlands, whose names end in vliet, and those in England, ending in the fleet, as Purfleet, Byfleet, & c. Flevus Latin word is the same type, and derived from the same source, because, instead of Huneflot Hareflot and some old data have Hareflou and Huneflou, and others Barfleu, conditions approaching flevus, which is also called by Ptolemy, fleus, and Mela, fletio.
