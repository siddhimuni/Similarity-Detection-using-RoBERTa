The subservience on the question of Slavery, which has hitherto characterized both the great
parties of the country, has strengthened the hands of the extremists at the South, and has
enabled them to get the control of public opinion there by fostering false notions of Southern
superiority and Northern want of principle. We have done so much to make them believe in their
importance to us, and given them so little occasion even to suspect our importance to them,
that we have taught them to regard themselves as the natural rulers of the country, and to
look upon the Union as a favor granted to our weakness, whose withdrawal would be our ruin.
Accordingly, they have grown more and more exacting, till at length the hack politicians of
the Free States have become so imbued with the notion of yielding, and so incapable of believing
in any principle of action higher than temporary expedients to carry an election, or any object
nobler than the mere possession of office for its own sake, that Mr. Buchanan gravely proposes
that the Republican party should pacify South Carolina by surrendering the very creed that
called it into existence and holds it together, the only fruit of its victory that made victory
worth having. Worse than this, when the Free States by overwhelming majorities have just expressed
their conviction, that slavery, as he creature of local law, can claim no legitimate extension
beyond the limits of that law, he asks their consent to denationalize freedom and to nationalize
slavery by an amendment of the Federal Constitution, that shall make the local law of the Slave
States paramount throughout the Union. Mr. Buchanan would stay the yellow fever by abolishing
the quarantine hospital and planting a good virulent case or two in every village in the land.

We do not underestimate the gravity of the present crisis, and we agree that nothing should
be done to exasperate it; but if the people of the Free States have been taught anything by
the repeated lessons of bitter experience, it has been that submission is not the seed of conciliation,
but of contempt and encroachment. The wolf never goes for mutton to the mastiff.
