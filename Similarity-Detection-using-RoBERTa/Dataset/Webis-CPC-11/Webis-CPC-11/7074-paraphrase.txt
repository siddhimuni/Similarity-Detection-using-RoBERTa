He has perhaps never and never may be.  He doesn't have any desires or necessities, but one weakness, his daughter.  

She is young and lovely.  He has educated her far from Vienna.  

She now lives with a respectable family in Vienna, but she never visits him or inquires about him in the castle because of fear that someone would see her.  She is in love with a young doctor.  They want to get married, but he has no practice, and she doesn't have money.  Her father hasn't saved anything, because he spent all his money on her education, and doesn't have dowry money for her.  

And he means to argue with the empress for this dower?  

If he even thought of that, he would dismiss the thought, because his pride permits him from asking for anything from the empress.
