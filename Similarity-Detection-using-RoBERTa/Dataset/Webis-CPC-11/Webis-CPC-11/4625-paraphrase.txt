It was not easy to give the stories of men and women in terms familiar to the apprehension of a very young mind. For the young has also been my intention to write about everything, because boys are usually allowed to use the libraries of their parents at a much earlier age than girls, often with the best scenes of Shakespeare by heart before that their sisters are allowed to search this book manly, and therefore, instead of recommending these Tales of the reading of the young gentlemen who can read much better than the originals, I prefer to ask their kind assistance in explaining a her sisters as the hardest parts are so that they understand, they have helped them overcome difficulties, then maybe read them (carefully selecting what is proper to the ear of a younger sister) a passage to them pleasure in one of these stories, the same words of the scene is taken, and I trust that you will find that the beautiful extracts, selected passages, you may choose to give their sisters in this way will much better enjoyed and understood your having a general idea of the history of one of these summaries imperfect - if done well, fortunately for sampling delicious any of you, my young readers, I hope they will have no worse effect on you who do you want a little older, they may be allowed to read the full length plays (such as a desire to be neither angry nor irrational). When time and leave of judicious friends shall put them in your hands, you will discover in them as are here abridged (not to mention almost as many are left untouched) many surprising events and turns of fortune and, by their infinite variety can not be contained in this little book, and a world of lively and cheerful characters, both men and women, the mood I was afraid to lose if I tried to reduce their duration.

A Midsummer Night's Dream

(By Mary Lamb)

There was a law in the city of Athens, which gave citizens the power to force their daughters to marry whomever they wished, a daughter because she refused to marry the man her father had chosen as her husband, father was empowered by the law for her to be put to death, but parents often do not desire the death of his own daughters, even though they happen to try a bit of refractory, this law was seldom or never put running, but perhaps the young ladies of that city were not unfrequently threatened by their parents with the terrors of the same.
