This ejectment were served, processes, and obtained decrees, which, if followed and implemented, would put more people in possession, not deny, but nine tenths of these are compromised by paying part of rent, days before process comes from, and obtained decrees, most are never enforced.

Ejectment-processes are most effective and cheapest means by which the owner may require payment of rent due and, as such, they are generally resorted to: before being driven, at least three months must have elapsed after the rent year (which is the least amount that can be released) has fallen due.
