For thousands of years, it has been believed that of all species, bees have the most similar moral values compared to man. This is not due to the fact that they work hard and build sound structures but because of their monarchy.
Some historians wrote notable literature/playwrites about their (bees) instinctive, refined form of polity serving as "a great moral lesson" to man.
It is shameful how man has unfairly shunned the animal kingdom for behaving as nature intended. We commonly mock and label others as savage "beasts" when behaving unruly however desire to have the courage of a lion, brawn of an ox or agility of a feline.
No one argues the instinctive class and political distribution amongst the bees. Does this definitively prove that monarchy is an instinct of nature?
In further pondering the significance of that question, man will continue to entrap and disregard the abundant role bees serve.
