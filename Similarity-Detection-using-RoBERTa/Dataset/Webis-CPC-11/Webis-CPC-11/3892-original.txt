[Pageheading: INDUSTRIAL RIOTS.]

The disturbances which broke out again and again during the years 1816-19 were partly the outcome
of sheer destitution among the working classes, and partly of a growing demand for reform,
whether constitutional or revolutionary. The statesmen of the regency must not be too severely
judged if they often confounded these causes of seditious movements, and failed to distinguish
between the moderate and violent sections of reformers. Those who remembered the bloodthirsty
orgies of the French revolution, ushered in by quixotic visions of liberty, equality, and fraternity,
may perhaps be excused for distrusting the moderate professions of demagogues who deliberately
inflamed the passions of ignorant mobs. Moreover, the whigs and moderate reformers, who privately
condemned the excesses of their violent followers, made light of these in their public utterances,
and reserved all their censures for the repressive policy of the government. Bread riots had
begun before the harvest, which proved a total failure. The price of wheat, which was as low
as 52s. 6d. a quarter in January, 1816, rose to 103s. 1d. in January, 1817, and to 111s. 6d.
in June, 1817. And when rickburning set in as a consequence of agricultural depression, tumultuary
processions as a consequence of enforced idleness in the coal districts, and a revival of Luddism
as a consequence of stagnation in the various textile industries, itself due to a glut of British
goods on the continent, the reform party, now raising its head, was held responsible by the
government for a great part of these disorders.[64] The writings of Cobbett, especially his
Weekly Register, certainly had a wide influence in stirring up discontent against existing
institutions, but it must be admitted that he condemned the use of physical force, and pointed
to parliamentary reform as the legitimate cure for all social evils.
