How marvelous that the softest summer breeze, or the impalpable currents of the calmest day,
can be torn asunder with such suddenness and violence, by the accumulated energy that slumbers
in the imaginary atoms, as to give forth a sound like the rending of mountains or the detonations
of earthquakes!

Electricity is the soul of matter. If Whitman's paradox is true, that the soul and body are
one, in the same sense the scientific paradox is true: that matter and electricity are one,
and both are doubtless a phase of the universal ether--a reality which can be described only
in terms of the negation of matter. In a flash of lightning we see pure disembodied energy--probably
that which is the main-spring of the universe. Modern science is more and more inclined to
find the explanation of all vital phenomena in electrical stress and change. We know that an
electric current will bring about chemical changes otherwise impracticable. Nerve force, if
not a form of electricity, is probably inseparable from it. Chemical changes equivalent to
the combustion of fuel and the corresponding amount of available energy released have not yet
been achieved outside of the living body without great loss. The living body makes a short
cut from fuel to energy, and this avoids the wasteful process of the engine. What part electricity
plays in this process is, of course, only conjectural.

Our daily lives go on for the most part in two worlds, the world of mechanical transposition
and the world of chemical transformations, but we are usually conscious only of the former.
This is the visible, palpable world of motion and change that rushes and roars around us in
the winds, the storms, the floods, the moving and falling bodies, and the whole panorama of
our material civilization; the latter is the world of silent, invisible, unsleeping, and all-potent
chemical reactions that take place all about us and is confined to the atoms and molecules
of matter, as the former is confined to its visible aggregates.

Mechanical forces and chemical affinities rule our physical lives, and indirectly our psychic
lives as well. When we come into the world and draw our first breath, mechanics and chemistry
start us on our career. Breathing is a mechanical, or a mechanico-vital, act; the mechanical
principle involved is the same as that involved in the working of a bellows, but the oxidation
of the blood when the air enters the lungs is a chemical act, or a chemico-vital act. The air
gives up a part of its oxygen, which goes into the arterial circulation, and its place is taken
by carbonic-acid gas and watery vapor. The oxygen feeds and keeps going the flame of life,
as literally as it feeds and keeps going the fires in our stoves and furnaces.
