Not long after, so cleverly disguised in a suit as to deceive even herself, Percival was again at Aberdeen - to determine, if all other methods fail, to bring his relatives on the very eve of the bride, and more of a sunset, when the minister Sat on books or took a nap after dinner, did the two young creatures gather, unseen and unsuspected, on the banks of Dee.
