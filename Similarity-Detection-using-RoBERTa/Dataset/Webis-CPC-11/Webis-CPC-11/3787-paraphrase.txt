The son of the Red Elk would have more than likely stayed with his cherished love on the island, but he replayed the words of the Master of Life in his bind with the pauses of the breeze, saying: 
"Go back to they own land, hunter. Your time has not yet come. You have not yet performed the work I have for you to do, nor can you yet enjoy those pleasures which belong to them who have performed their allotted task on earth. Go back, then. In thime thou shalt rejoin her, the love of whom has brought thee hither."
MACHINITOU, THE EVIL SPIRIT.
The once Master of Life, Chemanitou caused not only himself but others like him discomfort. He was an accidental birth. 
Known as the Long Island, Metowac was an enormous plain that it looked like nothing was to grow on it,that it was just a part of the great sea.  
Some of these establishments were so big that they had to be spread out, not clumped together.They were so strong that Chemanitou couldn't control them himself. Chemanitou's way was to test these creations with powers and if they didnt work out they would be drained of life from him.
