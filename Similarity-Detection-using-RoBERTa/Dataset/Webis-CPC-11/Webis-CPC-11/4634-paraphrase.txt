Cibber and Macklin are surviving in the best days of Gaeeick.Peg Woffington and Kitty Clive were always praising the better days of the Wilks.Betterton and Elizabeth Barry,aged playgoers of the period of Edmund Kean and John Philip Kemble were firmly persuaded that the drama had been buried,never to rise again, with the dust with the dust of Garrick and Henderson beneath the pavement of Westminster Abbey.Less than fifty years aga an American historian of the stage(James Rees,1845)described it as a wreck,overwhelmed with"gloom and eternal night", above which the genius of the drama was mournfully presiding in the likeness of an owl.The New York veteran of to-day although has sad gaze may not penetrate backward quite to the efflugent splendours of the Old Park will sigh for Burton's and the olympic along with the luminous period of Mrs.Richardson,Mary Taylor and Tom Hamblin.The Philadelphia veteran gazes back to the golden era of the old Chestnut Street Theatre,the epoch of tie-wigs,shoe-buckles and the illustrious times of Wood and Warren.When Fennell,Cooke,Cooper,Wallack and J.B Boothe were shining names in tragedy and Jefferson and William Twaits were great comedians,the beautiful Anne Brunton was the queen of the stage.The boston veteran speaks proudly of the Old Federal and Old Tremont of Mary Duff,Julia Pelby,Charles Eaton,Ciara Fisher and is even begining to gild with the reminiscent splendour of the first days of the Boston Theatre when Thomas Barry and Mrs.John Wood contended for the public favour.In a word,the age that has seen Rachel,Seebach,Ristori,Charlotte Cushman and Adelaide Neilsonin comparison with the age that sees Elle Terry,Mary Anderson,Edwin Booth,Joseph Jefferson,Henry Irving,Salvini,Coquelin,Lawrence Barnett,John GIlbert,John.S.Clarke,Ada Rehan,James Lewis,Clara Morris and Richard Mansfield is a sterile period-"too long shut in strait period"-which ought to have felt the spell of Cooper and Mary Buff and known what acting was when Cooke's long forefinger pointed the way,Dunlap bore the banner,pretty Mrs.Marshall bewitched the father of his country,Dowton raised the laugh,lovely Mrs.Barrett melted the heart and the roses were"bright by the calm Bendemeer".
