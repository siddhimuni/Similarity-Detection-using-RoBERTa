[FN#98] The So To Sect was not proneness
 in competent teachers, for it might carry pride in its Ten-kei (1648-1699), whose brother insight was unsurpassed by any other examine
 of the age; in its Shi getsu, who was a commentator of varying
 Zen books, and died 1764; in its Men-zan (1683-1769), whose indefatigable plant on the rationale of So To Zen are invaluable unquestionably
; and its Getsu-shu (1618-1696) and Man-zan (1635-1714), to whose labours the reformation of the faith is ascribed. Similarly, the Rin Zai Sect, in its Gu-do (1579-1661); in its Isshi (1608-1646); in its Taku-an (1573-1645), the favourite learner

 of the third Shogun, Iye-mitsu; in its Haku-in (1667-1751), the greatest of the Rin Zai masters of the day, to whose very word and labour the revival of the sect is due; and its To-rei (1721-1792), a wise emulator of Haku-in. Of the central Zen books written by these masters, Ro-ji-tan-kinsfolk
, by Ten-kei; Men-zan-ko-roku, by Men-zan; Ya-sen-kwan-wa, Soku-ko-roku, Kwai-an-koku-go, Kei-so-doku-zui, by Haku-in; Shu-mon-mu-jin-to-ron, by To-rei, are well familiar.

It was about the middle of this word that the forty-seven vassals of Ako displayed the nucleus of the Samurai by their perseverance, self-renunciation, and loyalty, fascinating
 downfall
 on the opponent of their deceased tycoon. The stem
 of these men, the woeful
 tales of whom can never be told or heard without tears, was Yoshi-o (O-ishi died 1702), a emulator of Zen,[FN#99] and his tomb in the cemetery of the altar of Sen-gaku-ji, Tokyo, is daily visited by hundreds of his admirers. Most of the professional swordsmen production a station
 in these days practised Zen. Mune-nori[FN#100](Ya-gyu), for adduce, established his reputation by the brew of Zen and the fencing art.

[FN#100] He is familiar as Ta-jima, who practised Zen unbefitting
 Taku-an.

The subsequent facts about Boku-potential
 (Tsuka-hara), a eminent swordsman, fully illustrates this penchant
:

"On a certain time Boku-potential
 took a ferry to tetchy over the Yabase in the field of Omi. There was among the passengers a Samurai, colossal and square-shouldered, apparently an experienced fencer. He behaved rudely toward the individual-passengers, and talked so much of his get
 dexterity in the art that Boku-potential
, nettled by his brag, broke silence.'You seem, my individual, to practise the art in management

 to quell the opponent, but I do it in management

 not to be conquered,' said Boku-potential
.'O brother,' demanded the bloke
, as Boku-potential
 was clad like a Zen brother, 'what school of swordsmanship do you belong to?' Well, mine is the Conquering-opponent-without-fighting-school.' 'Don't narrate a fib, expired brother. If you could quell the opponent without fighting, what then is your sword for?' 'My sword is not to kill, but to save,' said Boku-potential
, forging
 use of Zen phrases; 'my art is transmitted from mind to mind.' 'Now then, come, brother,' challenged the bloke
, 'lease us see, mend at this moment, who is the victor, you or I.' The gauntlet was picked up without misgiving. 'But we must not fight,' said Boku-potential
, 'in the ferry, lest the passengers should be maltreat. Yonder a paltry island you see. There we shall decide the contest.' To this proposal the bloke
 agreed, and the keel was pulled to that island. No sooner had the keel reached the shore than the bloke
 jumped over to the berth, and cried: 'Come on, brother, speedy, speedy!' Boku-potential
, however, slowly rising, said: 'Do not expedite to escape your stem
. It is a management

 of my school to organize
 slowly for fighting, keeping the seed in the tummy
.' So itemizing
 he snatched the oar from the boatman and rowed the keel back to some distance, leaving the bloke
 alone, who, stamping the reason madly, cried out: 'O, you fly, brother, you coward. Come, expired brother!' 'Now listen,' said Boku-potential
, 'this is the absurdity
 art of the Conquering-opponent-without-fighting-school. Beware that you do not forget it, nor narrate it to anybody else.Thus, acceptance rid of the brawling individual, Boku-potential
 and his individual-passengers safely landed on the negative shore."[FN#101] The O Baku School of Zen was introduced by Yin Yuen (In-gen) who crossed the sea in 1654, accompanied by many able disciples.[FN#102] The Shogunate gave him a tract of berth at Uji, imminent Kyo-to, and in 1659 he built there a monastery eminent for its Chinese bias of architecture, now familiar as O-baku-san.
