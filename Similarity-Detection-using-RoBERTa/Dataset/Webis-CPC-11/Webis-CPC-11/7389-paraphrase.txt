Her aunt, although kind, indulgent, and pitying her, was bound in complete serfdom to her brother. She was quite unable to suggest any means or likelihood of release; so Barbara wrote a full account of her predicament to her lover. Not long afterward, Percival was again at Aberdeen--determined, should all other methods fail, to carry off his kinswoman on the very eve of the bridal; and many a twilight evening, when the minister sat over books or took his after-dinner nap, did those two young creatures meet, on the banks of the Dee. But those meetings must soon end, for six months have passed, and Mr. Bruce--once more lodged in the house of Davy Bain--is come to wed and take home his reluctant bride.
One evening John Percival betook himself as usual to the customary trysting-place. It was a thick copse of hazel past which ran--heard but not seen--the river; which, where the shrubbery ended, formed a dark, deep pool. Beyond this pool lay the road to the manse; but as the trees here ceased to offer concealment, the Nut-tree-hole became the limits to Percival's attendance on his cousin in her way homeward.
