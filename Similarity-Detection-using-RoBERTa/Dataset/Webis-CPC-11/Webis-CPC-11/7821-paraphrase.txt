29: 

The man whose head has been turned by poetry:

Ben Jonson said there's no hope for a young man infected with the taint of poetry. Indeed, he will have his Shakespeare, his Burns, his Eliot, his Sandburg, God help us, his Dickinson, always on the tip of his tongue or not much further back in his head, ready to inflict it upon the world at the slightest provocation, or, indeed, excuse.  His pleasure in doing so is evident in his eyes, his tone of voice, even his very posture and gesture, and is roughly in inverse proportion to the misery he metes out. 

He is unaware, insensible, or inconsiderate of the degree to which these un- called for, and uninspired parrotings make him an object of ridicule.  

I knew a student years ago, so enamoured of quoting poetry that I believe bits of rhyme and free verse were all the education he had, apparently without even attribution. 

When, by chance, he happened to recite a piece with which I was unfamiliar and which had a less hackneyed content and more graceful form than his usual fare, I inquired of him its author, he was entirely unable to enlighten me, having adopted the child and forgotten the parent.
