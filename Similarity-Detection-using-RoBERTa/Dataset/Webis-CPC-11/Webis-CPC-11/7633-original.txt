THERE ARE FEWER CHILDREN, BUT THEY ARE STRONGER (the
year 1920).

THESE CHILDREN, WITH THEIR ORIGINALITY AND ESOTERIC TENDENCIES WILL BRING ON A REVOLUTION ON
YOUR PLANET THAT WILL END BY DESTROYING YOUR THREADBARE DOGMATISM.  This tendency is evidenced
by the recent failure of the Interchurch movement.  It has been the habit on your planet that
you cannot accomplish anything without raising immense sums of money.

It is not money that does the real work but rather PERSONAL SERVICE.
