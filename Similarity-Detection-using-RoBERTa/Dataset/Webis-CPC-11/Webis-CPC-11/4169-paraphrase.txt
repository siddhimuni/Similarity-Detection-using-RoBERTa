There are three sub-orders proposed by A. Lameere: Cantharidiformia, which consists of Phytophaga, Hereromera, Rhynchophora and the majority of Sharp's categorisation of Polymorpha; Staphyliniformia, composed of rove-beetles, carrion-beetles and the remaining families of Polymorpha; and Carabidiformia, also known as Adephaga.  The basis of this categorisation is based upon formations of the abdomen, the arrangement of veins in the wings, a count of malpighian tubules along with other features.  Kolbe's classification may be better than Lameere's because it takes into account more adult characteristics as well as the larval stages.  Kolbe acknowledges additional sub-orders: Adephaga; Heterophaga (including Staphylinoidea, Arctinorhabda, also known as Lamellicornia, and Anchistopoda, also known as Phytophaga, which includes Ladybirds; and Rhynchophora.

Those studying the Coleoptera cannot concur on a classification methodology, nor on the specialization which can be considered by all concerned as natural.  Lameere regards some Cantharidiformia as basic Coleoptera.  Rhynchophora, or weevils, are in a distinct group based on Horn and Leconte's classification, because of their 'primitive' form.  Kolbe however believes weevils are the most specialized beetle, especially as the adult form develops from the substantially different limbless maggot.  Kolbe also believed the Adephaga, with its chitinous larvae with two clawed feet, as the most basic beetles; there cannot be much disagreement that strong similarities between larvae and adults can be characterized as a 'primitive' marker.  Coleoptera is a very well-established order with very few members that do not exhibit some form of specialization during their life cycles.  Therefore it is not possible to constuct a series with clearly defined boundaries.
