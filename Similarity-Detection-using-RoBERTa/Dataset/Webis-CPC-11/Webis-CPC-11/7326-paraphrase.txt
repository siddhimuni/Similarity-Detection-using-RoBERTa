Our boat took a poor man who had to swim for his life when the rest had fled for half an hour. Within three hours, I could not see more than three or four of their boats, and as a breeze that lifted the candle. 
At first, the man who took us on board do not eat or talk, and we were all afraid, lest they should pine to death. But when I had been taught to say a few words, told us his friends - the nature, the men had left their families to get a big fight and all that meant was that we do look at the big eyes. 

So that was why the poor dropped Friday! Which had been so good and true for me as a man can be! And now, in deep sorrow I have to say goodbye to him. 

We went with a favorable wind to the Bay of All Saints, and here I was with a sloop that had brought me home, I could send men and stores for use by my friends on the island. 

Mate taught me how to find the place, and when he returned, I found that I had done with ease. 

One of the crew had a great desire to go with the boat, and live on the island, if the boss would give the land to cultivate. So I said I should go by all means, and gave the wild man of his slave. I found also that a man who had come with his wife and son and three slaves, to hide the king of Spain, would like to go, if I could have some land that, although he was only carrying a small stock to him, so I put them all on board the boat, and saw them safe from the bay on their way to the island. 

With them I sent three cows, five calves, a horse and pony, all of which, as I heard, was unharmed. 

I do not feel more to say on my island, as he had left last time, but life on land not far from home unless it was not yet finished.
