Honestly speaking, I am unable towards employ within a drama of intrigue a la Verre d'Eau; whether this were the alone distance open towards me, I should pack my bundle tomorrow and settle down within a German village; profession I shall as much as I can, but towards sell my ware within this market is impossible towards me. Artistic affairs here are within so vile a mood, so rotten, so install for decay, that alone a bold scytheman is required whom realises the right cut. Dearest ally, apart from everybody political speculation, I am coerced towards say truthfully that within the soil of the anti-Revolution none art can evolve, nor possibly could it for the show within the soil of the Revolution, unless care were taken--in time. To speak briefly, tomorrow I shall initiate a searching article onto the theatre of the future for a number of meaningful, political journal. I assure you towards flee politics onto one side as much as possible, and consequently shall not compromise you or any one else; but as far as art and the theatre are feared you ought, with a nice grace, allow me towards be as red as possible, for a very desperate colour is the alone one of consume towards us. This, I think, is my most prudent course towards adopt, and he whom tells it for prudential reasons as the most effective one is nobody else than your businessman Belloni. He informs me that here I need finance as much as M. or genuinely many than M., or else I ought earn myself feared. Well, finance I possess not, but a tremendous yearn towards tradition a little artistic terrorism. Give me your blessing, or, better still, grant me your assistance.
