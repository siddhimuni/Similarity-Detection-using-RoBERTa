Since it happened that my horse was going crazy, it too a long time to find water. It was almost dark before we did. Not even grass could be found for the horse. Once we finally found these necessities, we figured we had better find shelter because the sky looked like rain. My horse could sense it too.

We had already hit the road when the sun came up at 6 am. Even with such an early departure, we did not arrive at the camp until 12:30 pm. Even though we weren't there, the group of my comrades had successfully caught a few fish and other small game had been shot. This was extremely exciting news because we had not eaten real food in weeks among weeks and we were becoming quite malnutritioned.

We were foced to cross to the other side of the river because the valley on the side that we were on was extremely rocky and unable to be passed by horse or foot. The side of the river that we had to move to was quite sandy. We started out south-east and kept going in this direction for about three hours or so. We were so thirsty that we welcomed the sight of the stream that lay in a deep valley that was surrounded by enormous cliffs. I would say these cliffs range anywhere from 50 to 200 feet in height. The thought of these cliffs brought to mind the journey that we would have to make through them and I was sure they would be impassable. I decided to follow the river which now was steering completely south. I followed this until about 5pm when I found a path through the rocky ravines. It was dangerous, but I had to cross somehow. Once I got through this horror, we were given grass and water as a present from mother nature.
