"True," answered Job, "but you don't reflect that without disguise you may hereafter be recognized;
our friends walk in Bond-street, as well as your honour; and, in that case, you might be shot
without a second, as the saying is."

"You have convinced me," said I; "and now, before we start, let me say one word further respecting
our object. I tell you, fairly, that I think Dawson's written deposition but a secondary point;
and, for this reason, should it not be supported by any circumstantial or local evidence, hereafter
to be ascertained, it may be quite insufficient fully to acquit Glanville (in spite of all
appearances), and criminate the real murderers. If, therefore, it be possible to carry off
Dawson, after having secured his confession, we must. I think it right to insist more particularly
on this point, as you appeared to me rather averse to it this morning."

"I say ditto to your honour," returned Job; "and you may be sure that I shall do all in my
power to effect your object, not only from that love of virtue which is implanted in my mind,
when no stronger inducement leads me astray, but from the more worldly reminiscence, that the
annuity we have agreed upon is only to be given in case of success--not merely for well meaning
attempts. To say that I have no objection to the release of Dawson, would be to deceive your
honour; I own that I have; and the objection is, first, my fear lest he should peach respecting
other affairs besides the murder of Sir John Tyrrell; and, secondly, my scruples as to appearing
to interfere with his escape.
