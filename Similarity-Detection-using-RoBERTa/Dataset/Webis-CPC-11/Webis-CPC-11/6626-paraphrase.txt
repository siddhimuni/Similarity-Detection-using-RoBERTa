(2.) Greeks, related to Helli, Selli, [Greek: selas, Heule, Helios]. This derivation is more likely {28} by the fact that the neighboring tribes Pelasgic have a similar meaning, eg 
Perrhæbi similar to Pyrrha and [Greek: com]; Æthices, [Greek aith] Tymphæi, [Greek: tuphô] Hestiæi, [Greek: Hestia]. 

Add to this that the name of Fthiotida certainly seems to get his name Phthah, the Egyptian Hephaestus, and a translation of the word Hellas. 

NB - The existence of an Egyptian colony in that part is attested by the existence of a Thebæ Phthiotic. 

(3.) Moreover, the word seems to be related Achaean [Greek: ACHOS, achnumai] and [Greek: achlus] in the sense of melancholy (the [Greek: ACHOS ouranion]). 

So the Cimmerians of Homer are derived from [Hebrew: KIMRIYRIY] (Job), which denotes the dark. 

(4. ) Finally, I present with great suspicion the next test of Doro words and Aeolian Minyæ, I'm going to try to derive from words denoting the sun and moon respectively. 

I suppose the Doro word to be connected to the first part of the names on dry sole proprietors and sole proprietorships Dol. Metathesis in the first case seems sanctioned by the analogy of IRD Sanskrit and Greek [Greek: Deiro] lyr mutation and the second is very common in Greek and Latin to admit of any doubt, for example, [Greek: ar-Gale] and [Greek: algaletos] Soracte Sun. With this premise, I think it can be justified in connecting the words together.
