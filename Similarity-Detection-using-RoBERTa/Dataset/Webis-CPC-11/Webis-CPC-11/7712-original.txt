Polignac's infantry, twelve hundred muskets, was posted on the Boeuf within supporting distance
of the two last. Liddell's seven hundred newly-organized horse, with four guns, was of little
service beyond making feints to distract the enemy.

Major reached his position on the 30th, and on the following day, the 1st of May, captured
and sunk the transport Emma. On the 3d he captured the transport City Belle, on her way up
to Alexandria, with the 120th Ohio regiment on board. All the officers and two hundred and
seventy-six men were taken, with many killed and wounded. On the evening of the 4th the gunboats
Covington and Signal, each mounting eight heavy guns, with the transport Warner, attempted
to pass. The Covington was blown up by her crew to escape capture, but the Signal and Warner
surrendered. Four guns, two three-inch rifled and two howitzers, were engaged in this action
with the Covington and Signal. They were run up to the river's bank by hand, the howitzers
above, the three-inch rifles below the gunboats, which, overpowered by the rapid fire, moved
back and forth until one surrendered and the other was destroyed, affording a complete illustration
of the superiority of field guns to gunboats in narrow streams. There was no further attempt
to pass Major's position, and Federal communication with the Mississippi was closed for fifteen
days.

During these operations the enemy was engaged night and day in the construction of a dam across
the Red River, to enable him to pass his fleet over the falls; and the following extracts from
the report of Admiral Porter to the Secretary of the Navy well exhibit the condition of affairs
in and around Alexandria ("Report on the Conduct of the War," vol. ii., page 250):

"FLAG-SHIP CRICKET, ALEXANDRIA, April 28, 1864.

"SIR: I have written you an account of the operations of the fleet in these waters, but take
the liberty of writing to you confidentially the true state of affairs.
