"It is next to impossible that an American gentleman would do such a thing, and if he did, I would consider that he had reduced himself to the level of a snob, and I would treat him as I would any snob in the streets.  I would knock him down, if I were able; and if I weren't, the the law of him; and, if a man had wronged me irreparably, I fancy I would do as these uncivilized Southerners themselves would do in such a case,--shoot him down in the street where I ever to catch him.  What sense or justice is there is a duel? It is as if the man stole your coat, and instead of having him put into prison, you drew lots with him as to whether you or he should go."

"Suppose a man were spreading false reports about you?  Suppose this same man said you were no gentlemen and that you had cheated someone.?

"Bah!" replied Benson, dexterously evading the most important part of the question. Were I to fight all the people that spread false reports about, I would have my hands full. There is a man in this very room that grossly slandered me four years ago, and nearly cost me my marriage.  That fat man there, with all the jewerly--Storey Hunter."

"Indeed!" exclaimed the other, really surprised, for he had witnessed Mrs. Benson conversing with the ponderous exquisite, apparently on the most amicable terms.

"Yes, and it was entirely gratuitous. I never gave the scamp any provocation whatsoever.  By Jupiter!" Benson turned white and then very red.  He's dancing with my wife!  His impudence is too much for me to bear. To think that one of our women would put with such a man if he were able to dance well.  They have absolutely no self-respect."
