BUDAPEST [A]

By H. Torn OF KÖVËR

Budapest is one of the cities located in Europe. Nobody can forget the wonderful sister cities divided by two large and rapidly flowing Danube, with boats and barges on its waters. Buda, the old city is on the one hand, the fantastic "Gellert" hill, which is a formidable-looking mass of rocks and caves, further, is wonderful with its gardens royal palace, beautifully kept clinging to the hill, then the oldest part, called the citadel, which was rebuilt exactly in the style of Matthias Corvinus built, and which was demolished during the Turkish invasion. Here is Matthew's old church also, but not so much restored that has the appearance of age. Behind those larger smaller hills are to be seen covered with shady forests, which are regions mansion tours and summer jobs for people.

Along the Danube are green and shady islands of which the most beautiful island of St. Margaret's, on the other side of the water is the city "over", with houses majestic Parliament, Palace of Justice, Academy of Sciences, and many other buildings well. Currently, four bridges join the two towns together, and a huge tunnel leading through the first hills of Buda in another part of town. Can not tell which is the most beautiful view: to look in Pest, which lies at ground level to hilly landscape ranging from the Buddha or to look at the hill behind the fairy-land fish with large silver Danube remote remove a large snake winding its scales, all aglitter in the sun. It's beautiful day, especially at night, for myriads of lights shining in the water and hills are dotted with the flitting fairy lamps. Even those who are used to look at it in rapture to the words and wonder. What should be its foreign!
