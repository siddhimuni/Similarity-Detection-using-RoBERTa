The whole exhibited a magnificent spectacle; but to have
enjoyed it fully, we should have breathed an air clear of insects.

The most depressing of all physical sufferings are those which are uniform in their duration,
and can be combated only by long patience. It is probable, that in the exhalations of the forests
of the Cassiquiare M. Bonpland imbibed the seeds of a severe malady, under which he nearly
sunk on our arrival at Angostura. Happily for him and for me, nothing led us to presage the
danger with which he was menaced. The view of the river, and the hum of the insects, were a
little monotonous; but some remains of our natural cheerfulness enabled us to find sources
of relief during our wearisome passage. We discovered, that by eating small portions of dry
cacao ground without sugar, and drinking a large quantity of the river water, we succeeded
in appeasing our appetite for several hours. The ants and the mosquitos troubled us more than
the humidity and the want of food. Notwithstanding the privations to which we were exposed
during our excursions in the Cordilleras, the navigation from Mandavaca to Esmeralda has always
appeared to us the most painful part of our travels in America. I advise those who are not
very desirous of seeing the great bifurcation of the Orinoco, to take the way of the Atabapo
in preference to that of the Cassiquiare.

Above the Cano Duractumuni, the Cassiquiare pursues a uniform direction from north-east to
south-west. We were surprised to see how much the high steep banks of the Cassiquiare had been
undermined on each side by the sudden risings of the water. Uprooted trees formed as it were
natural rafts; and being half-buried in the mud, they were extremely dangerous for canoes.
We passed the night of the 20th of May, the last of our passage on the Cassiquiare, near the
point of the bifurcation of the Orinoco.
