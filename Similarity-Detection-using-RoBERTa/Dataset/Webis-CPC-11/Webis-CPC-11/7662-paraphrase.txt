Take the name Mona, both human and heavenly. I think we can find its root in the Sanskrit language. It means "To know or worship," which has given us many variations; Manu the son of Brahma, Menu, Menes, Minos, Moonshee, and Monk. Mona was probably applied to those of both islands, especially those that contained Druids, whose name probably came from the dru, a soothsayer, almost the same as the Sanskrit "mooni," a learned person. This relation leads me to ask: Might these two variations of Mona be the abode of piety and wisdom, the "fortunate island,"  as it were?
