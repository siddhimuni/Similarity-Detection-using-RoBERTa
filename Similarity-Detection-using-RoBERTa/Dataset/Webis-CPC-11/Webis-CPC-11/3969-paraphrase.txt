THE SKEPTIC'S POINT OF VIEW ON THE RESULT OF IGNORANCE.

"Forgetfulness happening once can be noticed at times in places where you would not expect to find it; they young mind being educated and to process an endeavor of scientific inquiry, these are two things which are easily distinguished; the education demands faith, and the scientific inquiry requires doubt; education is the work of the church and science is the work of people. Althou the Duke of Somerset attends church, and discovers on ignorant group of people calm in a delightful place of false perception, all the while the more educated of the people are skeptical to these new ideas. The pastors now  cheer to faith in vain. ***  The Protestant usually reads his Bible; he tries and wishes to believe.*** Nothing is accomplished from these efforts." Christian Theology and Modern Skepticism, 1872 p.144.

"The Protestant and the Duke are plainly trying to at once do two things, and of course, Professor Huxley is also tempted to do this." Lay Sermons p. 21 "But then keen enough is he to think something unreasonable in the position, and to realisticly says that the army of liberal thinking is currently not in tight order; and many liberal thinkers use this freedom to espress ludicrous thoughts" Lay Sermons p.69

To be skeptical is to have wisdom, and ignorance is bliss according to the named quotations.

Give me a calm place of false perceptions; " Let me confide in them; if I am let down in the end I shall end up the same as the skeptic, with this being the difference, and if there is a hereafter, i will be aware that in my ignorance I lived a blessed life which included reference to the currently experienced eternity;but, just in case the hereafter does not exist, equal we shall be. I say it again, give me the angle where I have no risks to take when looked at from the skeptic's point of view and where I can "confide in a calm place of false perceptions," in preference to the skeptic's annoying nonbelief.
