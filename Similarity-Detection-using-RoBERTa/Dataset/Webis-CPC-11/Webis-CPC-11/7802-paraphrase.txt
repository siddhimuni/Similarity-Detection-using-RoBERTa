The sight is, consequently, coerced towards flee the sensations whereas they are, and the nervousness of them whereas it is; and towards recognize the two as sundered from each other--the sensations as discriminated from the organ, which they actually are. Thus it is that we would explain the starting point of the perception of interval via the eye; suspecting firmly that the sight would never possess noticed this interval without the mediation of the touch. 
Rightly towards appreciate the foregoing reasoning--indeed towards approach a single pace within the true philosophy of sensation--we much divest ourselves of the prejudice impressed into ourselves via a fake physiology, that what we dub our organism, or, within plain vocabulary, our body, is essentially the seat of our sensations. That everybody our sensations arrive towards be associated within a number of distance with this body, and that a number of of them even arrive towards be associated with it within site, is undeniable; but so far is it from being true, that they are everybody fundamentally implicated or incorporated with it, and cannot exist at a interval from it, that we possess a organise proof towards the contrary within our sensations of vision; and until the physiologist can prove (what has never yet been proven) an à priori necessity that our sensations ought be whereas our bodies are, and an à priori absurdity within the contrary supposition, he ought forgive ourselves for decisively standing via the fact as we encounter it. 

This is a look which admits of much debate, and we would gladly expatiate upon the issue, did moment and space permit; but we ought content ourselves with winding up the show comments with the ushering figure, which we think explains our look beyond the opportunity of a mistake.

Let A be the original synthesis, or indiscrimination of dream and its sensations--of light and colours.
