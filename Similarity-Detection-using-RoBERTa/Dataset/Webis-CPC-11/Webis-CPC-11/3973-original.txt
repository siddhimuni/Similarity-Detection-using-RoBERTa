That copies may still exist in this country is shown to be possible by the fact (recorded
by Willems) that one was sold at an auction in Belfast. Another was found at Brighton, and
occasionally one appears in the London salerooms, as we have shown. It requires little imagination
to picture merchants and travellers, whose paths led through the Low Countries at that time,
slipping copies into their pockets or holsters for use in the household across the water. Many
a courtly exile during the Protectorate, glancing through the bookshops of Amsterdam, must
have chanced upon the little volume as a gift for wife or daughter.

Numbers, also, must have found their way to France. Some years ago our book-hunter happened
to stay at an ancient hostel in Rouen. From the outside the building was everything that could
possibly be desired by bibliophile or antiquary. It was situated in one of those quaint narrow
back streets that lead towards the Place Henri Quatre; and the courtyard was so small as scarcely
to allow a baker's cart to turn round in it. Like many of the houses in this ancient town,
its crookedness was such that it seemed impossible for it to remain standing much longer. Misgivings
arose within him as he ascended the staircase, which seemed to sway as he avoided the broken
treads. But the sight of the bedroom he was to occupy, furnished with such furniture and such
a bed, all spotlessly clean and polished, sent him into the seventh heaven of delight. Here
he could read and write undisturbed for as long as he chose to stay. Surely pleasant surprises
must be in store for one in every way in such surroundings as these!

It was not long before he got one.

'Will Monsieur require anything to be cooked for him to-night?' inquired the trim hostess.

It was rather late and our bookman was disinclined to seek a restaurant. Besides, he was anxious
to explore his lodging before it got too dark. An omelette would be delicious, provided she
could make one properly.
