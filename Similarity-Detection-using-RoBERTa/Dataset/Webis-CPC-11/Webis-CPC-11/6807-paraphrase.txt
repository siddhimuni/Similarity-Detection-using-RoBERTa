As he looked at Palma, he saw that on her tongue was the body of Christ in the communion wafer that, which was easy because her eyes were shut and her mouth open.  He right away knelt down, too, and worshipped it.  She stuck her tongue out even more seemingly to show him that it was actually there before she closed her mouth and ate it, staying completely still on the sofa she was lying on.  It was almost dusk, around 4pm, and the room just had one small high window.   The wafer had looked to him like thick white wax.  Because it was almost dark and because of the brief time it appeared, he couldn't tell whether it had the marks of the church on it.

We should also say with regard to what happened that Palma told Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre that on a few occasions it was the devil who'd brought her this host--the waver believed by most Christians to be Christ's actual body--and so she'd refused it on those occasions.

He sometimes disguised himself as an angel, but she still recognized him because he had a sign on his forehead, which was a little horn.  Also she noticed that he was hesitant and embarrassed.  That's when she sang the Gloria Patri and made the sign of the cross, causing him to immediately flee so that he disappeared.
