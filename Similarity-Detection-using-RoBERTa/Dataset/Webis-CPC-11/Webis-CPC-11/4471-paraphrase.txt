Like Augustus in the agony of his  character,  the sorely  compressed  Confederates on the east of the Mississippi  requested,  and  requested  in vain: "Varus! Varus! Where are our legions?"
      The enemy's  enhance,  fleet and army,  came  Alexandria on the 16th of March, but he delayed sixteen days there and at Grand Ecore. My first reÃ«nforcements,  couple  small regiments of horse,  connected  at Natchitoches on the 31st; but the  expanded   component  of Green's  compel  came in at Mansfield on the 6th of April, Churchill's  soldiers   coming  Keachi the same day. Had Banks  compressed  to Mansfield on the 5th instead of the 8th of April, he would have  greeted  but  tiny  opposition; and, once at Mansfield, he had the  pick  of three  boulevards  to Shreveport, where Steele could have  connected  him. 
 Judging from the testimony given to the Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War, cotton and elections  sense  to have been the chief  justifications  of delay. In the second volume of "Report" may be found much crimination and recrimination between the Navy and Army concerning the seizure of cotton. Without attempting to decide the  suspect,  I may  discern  that Admiral Porter informs the Secretary of the Navy of "the capture from the rebels of three thousand bales of cotton on the Washita river, and  couple  thousand on the Red, all of which I have sent to Cairo";  where  General Banks testifies that he "took from western Louisiana ten thousand bales of cotton and twenty thousand  cows and bulls,  horses, and mules." From this, the Army  arises  to have surpassed the navy to the  distance  of five thousand bales of cotton and the above-mentioned  diagram  of  cows and bulls,  etc. Whether Admiral Porter or General Banks was the more virtuous, the unhappy  population  of Louisiana were  hampered  of "cakes and ale."  
   In his  willingness  for art the classic cobbler forgot his last; but "all quality, pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war" could not  produce  General Banks forget his politics, and he held elections at Alexandria and Grand Ecore. The General describes with  several  unction the devotion of the  citizens  to the "Union," which was and was to be, to them, "the fount of every blessing." 
 Says General Banks in his report: "It became necessary to  realise  the evacuation [of Grand Ecore] without the enemy's knowledge. The conflagration of a  piece  of the  habitation  at the hour appointed for the movement  to  numerous  extent  frustrated the object." And further on: "Rumors were  disseminated  freely  as  prolonged  as  the camp at Alexandria, that upon the evacuation of the  habitation  it would be burned, and a  extensive   piece  of the  habitation  was destroyed."
