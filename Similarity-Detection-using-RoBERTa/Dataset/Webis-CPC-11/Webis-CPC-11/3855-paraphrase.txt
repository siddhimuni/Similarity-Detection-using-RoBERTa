Highlight a special wish, sir, next week? Elliston. No, Sam., I fear our special wishes are almost spent.

Prompter boy waiting at the door. Octavius Mr Clarke would be happy to speak with Mr. Elliston.

ELLISTON. He be d ---- d! Silence the noise between Messrs. Winston and Bunn - Waterloo and Tom show.

Madame VESTRIS. Elliston My dear, you mean to keep us here all day?

368 ~ ~ ~ ELLISTON (softly). I had rather take you all night, lady.

Sherwin (with G. Smith). I wish it may be true that one of our comedians will house The Other, Then Shall I stand some chance for a good little business - at present I have only two shares decent behind my back.

Liston (stiff as a pole). If I pass an opinion, I must have a salary increase, I move on these occasions.

MRS. ORGER (author). This part is not as good as Sally mags. I must take my friend's view in town.

MISS Stephens (laughs). I just play one stanza of this ballad - is too sentimental.

MISS Smithson (aside, but loud enough to hear the manager). Ton my honor, Mr. Elliston not throw me anything but sentimental and Ladies La La dolls.

G - Smith (with a full bass voice). Nor me anything but rough and men cottagers banditti, but never mind, my solos will trick bass.

GATT (yawn). I want to noon, because I'm half asleep, and I took an oath not to take snuff before twelve, if not believe me, ask Mrs. G. After the hit I made Monsieur Tonson, is d - d hard not to write French.
