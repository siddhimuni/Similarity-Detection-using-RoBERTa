There are niches in different places which once used to be the storage for the holy water. The pious devotees of former ages sprinkled these on their foreheads during their entrance before the altar. I am not sure if any other remains of the old church can be seen now. A pair of gates transient through the eastern end of the south aisle leads into the Chapel of Virgin Mary.

To the extent that we can remember of the character of this Chapel, the connoisseurs of architecture have little to grieve over its removal. E.E., Our Correspondent adds that it was not the Lady Chapel, but this (No. 456 of The Mirror) which contained the gravestone of one Bishop Wickham, who, nevertheless, was not the renowned builder of Windsor Castle, in the time of Edward III., but died in 1595, the same year in which he was translated from the sea of Lincoln to that of Winchester. His gravestone is now lying bare in the churchyard and marks the south-east corner of the site of the aforementioned Magdalen Chapel.
