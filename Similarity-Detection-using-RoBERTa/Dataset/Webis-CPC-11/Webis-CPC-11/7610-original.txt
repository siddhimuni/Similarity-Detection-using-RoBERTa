Census Bureau historical sketches of many of the leading cities of the country, and he has
become thoroughly convinced that of all the vulnerable portions of American literature that
which pertains to the history of American towns and cities is the most vulnerable.

In the first place, American town and city histories are few. In the second place, the books

both the real and the sham are intensely dull.

Real histories are few, evidently because there is not demand enough to encourage historians
to enter the field, and not because material is lacking.
