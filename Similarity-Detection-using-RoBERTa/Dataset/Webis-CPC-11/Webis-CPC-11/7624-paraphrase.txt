Among many works on the walls of the ground-floor art gallery, Tintret's famous painting, "The Annunciation" immediately catches the eye. Boldly executed and typically representive of Tintoret's work as whole, the expression on the face of the Virgin appears to change when viewed at different distances.  From afar she appears to be a rather plain woman in her thirties. Up close, surprise replaces the fear and pain on her features and she becomes youthful and lovely, leaving the viewer to wonder if this was Tintoret's intended effect all along or simply a unique accident.
