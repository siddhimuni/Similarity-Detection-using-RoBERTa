In the words of M. Saint-Marc, we can instruct and cultivate the mind.   However, we cannot cultivate or develop the heart.  M. Dubois, director of the Ecole Normale and M. Guizot, minister of public instruction offered similar evidence, which stated education is not up to the level of instruction.  This was extracted from an 1836 exposition of the intent of law. 

In the words of M de Montalembert, a fervent Catholic who was on the trial of free school in 1831, it is with a heart that is distressed and filled with these personal souvenirs that I declare I would rather see my children crawl in both ignorance and idleness rather than expose them to the horrible risk of obtaining a little knowledge.  For the cost of knowledge and education from College Professors who are not Hostile to religion but are not religious, is a price that Christians cannot afford.   The price of this education compromises their fatherâ€™s faith, virtue along with everything that is fresh and pure.  This is because religious education does not exist on college campuses.
