There the Volga, the Urals, the Syr Darya and the Oxus discharge their waters without reaching the coast, but continue to give life to the speed of drying Transcaspian Steppes, or connect to their network of rivers such as the Volga does, more remote parts of European Russia. 
The above-described features of the physical geography of the empire to explain the relative uniformity of this huge territory in comparison with the variety of physical properties in the suburbs. 

Also explain the rapid expansion of Slavic colonization in these sparsely populated regions, and also shed light on the internal cohesion of the empire, which can not fail to strike the traveler who crosses this immense territory, and is the same everywhere dominating the race, the same characteristics of life. 

In fact, in anticipation of the basins of the Dnieper Volkhoff and the foot of the Altai and Sayan mountains, that is, over almost a quarter of the circumference of the Earth, Russian settlers always find the same physical conditions, the same forest and meadows, as he had left at home, the same facilities for agriculture, only modified somewhat by minor topographical features. The new conditions of climate and soil, and consequently new cultures and civilizations, the Russians met with, in its expansion to the south and east, just beyond the Caucasus in the Aral region and the Caspian Sea, and the Ussuri basin on the Pacific coast. 

Buoyed by these conditions, not only the Russians conquered North Asia - the colonized. 

The Russian Empire is divided into two major subdivisions, Europe and Asia, the last one, representing a total of nearly 6,500. 000 square miles with a population of only sixteen million people can be considered as held by the colonies. 

The European dominions comprise European Russia, Finland, that is, in fact, a separate nationality to some extent treated as an ally of the state, and Poland, whose name has been erased from official documents, but nonetheless continuing its own development.
