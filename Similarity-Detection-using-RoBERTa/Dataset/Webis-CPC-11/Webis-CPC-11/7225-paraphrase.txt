But if the significance, be on the last consonant, though it is exactly right to place it there also in English, it is not benefit while to do so, for fear of making hearers talk about a astonishing sound, instead of attending to the service. It will be safer to stress the penultimate in dissyllables, and the antepenultimate in trisyllables, which in the Greek are acutitones; in fact, to verbalize as all clergymen used to pronounce, until a pedantic and ignorant practice arose of approaching, or rather emphasise, every syllable in the penultimate, which had or was believed to have a long quantity in Greek. 

So the comparatively new fashion of pronouncing [Greek: Sabaôth], [Greek: Zaboulôn], [Greek: sabachthani], [Greek: Akeldama], with a strong "significance on the penultima; whereas the old fashion way of accenting the antepenultima makes no one stare, and is a much nearer reaching to the true pronunciation. 

There is a analytical disparity in the common way of reading, in English, [Greek: Samareia] and [Greek: Kaisareia]. Samar[=i]a is decidedly a Greek word; but prior to, in this word, it is expected to accent the antepenultima. Cesar[)e]a is decidedly a Latin word Græcised, and prior to it is usual to read this with an accent on the penultima. I never observed any of those who read Sabáoth, Zabúlon, and sabachtháni, read either Samaría or Cesárea. The Greek accents on Hebrew words always concord, as Hebraists know, with the tonic accent in that language. 

E. C. H. As a significant addition to the desirable object of settling the pronunciation of the words above-mentioned,, the following representation of their pronunciation in the originals is offered. 

The vowels are to be read as in Italian, the th as in English, and the hh as ch in German: 
Hebrew. 

Sabaoth = ts[)i]-v[=a]-['=o]th. 
Hebrew. [The] Moriah = [h[)a]m-]m['=o]-r[=i]-y['=a]h. Syriac. Aceldama = hh[)i]-k[')a]l-d[)i]-m['=a]. 
Syro-Chaldee. Eli Eli lamma sabachthani = [=e]-l['=i] [=e]l['=i] l[)a]m-m['=a] s[)a]-b[')a]hh-t[)a]-n['=i], as in Matthew; or [)e]-l['=o]-h[=i], as in Mark.
