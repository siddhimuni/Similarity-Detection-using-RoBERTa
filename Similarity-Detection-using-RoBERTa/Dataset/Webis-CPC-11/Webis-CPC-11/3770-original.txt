I
find it sufficiently abundant, but not sufficiently pliable and vigorous; it commonly quails
under a powerful conception; if you would maintain the dignity of your style, you will often
perceive it to flag and languish under you, and there Latin steps in to its relief, as Greek
does to others.

The sciences treat of things too refinedly, after an artificial, very different from the common
and natural, way.  My page makes love, and understands it; but read to him Leo Hebraeus--[Leo
the Jew, Ficinus, Cardinal Bembo, and Mario Equicola all wrote Treatises on Love.]-- and Ficinus,
where they speak of love, its thoughts and actions, he understands it not.  I do not find in
Aristotle most of my ordinary motions; they are there covered and disguised in another robe
for the use of the schools.  Good speed them! were I of the trade, I would as much naturalise
art as they artificialise nature.  Let us let Bembo and Equicola alone.

When I write, I can very well spare both the company and the remembrance of books, lest they
should interrupt my progress; and also, in truth, the best authors too much humble and discourage
me: I am very much of the painter's mind, who, having represented cocks most wretchedly ill,
charged all his boys not to suffer any natural cock to come into his shop; and had rather need
to give myself a little lustre, of the invention of Antigenides the musician, who, when he
was asked to sing or play, took care beforehand that the auditory should, either before or
after, be satiated with some other ill musicians.  But I can hardly be without Plutarch; he
is so universal and so full, that upon all occasions, and what extravagant subject soever you
take in hand, he will still be at your elbow, and hold out to you a liberal and not to be exhausted
hand of riches and embellishments.
