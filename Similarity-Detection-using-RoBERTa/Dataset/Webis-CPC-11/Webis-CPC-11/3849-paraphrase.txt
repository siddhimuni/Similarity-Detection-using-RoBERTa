Chevalier, after dressing, rose with greatest air of courage and requested Levington to stay back a few minutes as he wanted to say a prayer in his closet before going to do a desparate piece of work and Levington agreed to wait while Chevalier went into his closet to pray. But when Chevalier concluded his prayer with the following words, "I truly believe that killing a man is a great sin and therefore request that all saints will intercede with Virgin on my behalf for once killing Mr. Bloteres at Rochelle,Chevalier of Cominge at Brest, Major Tierceville at Lyons, Lieutenant Marche Falliere at Paris, along with half a dozen other men in France, so killing him in the fight is a surety and I hope that the sin of killing him does not fall on me as he forced this fight  on me.", Levington heard this part of the prayer, levington thought that he should not fight chevalier as chevalier was expert fighter and killer and so left the place in a hurry. Chevelier was glad to find him absent on coming out of the closet.
Later another gentleman called Chevalier for a fight. Chevalier asked his opponent as to what the fight was for, when they met on Chelsea Fields as agreed upon and got Honour, reputation for a reply. Then chevelier yanked out a halter from his pocket and then tossed it towards his opponent and and said, that as the fight was about a piece of rope he, his opponent could win and wear it.
This comic act of Chevelier had a great effect on the opponent that he stopped fighting and became good friends with Chevalier.
