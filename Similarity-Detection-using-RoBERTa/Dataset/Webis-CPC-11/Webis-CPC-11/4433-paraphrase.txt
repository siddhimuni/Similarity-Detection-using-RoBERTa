At the moment probablu none of us were either at home nor at the seat of war.We reaslise the granseur of the situation and the dramatic power of the incident,and the titanic nature of the conflict who wer at the home,mothers,fathers, wives, sisters, brothers, citizens of the common country, if nothing else,the agony suspense the anxiet.The joy and too often the grief which was to know it has no end which marked the passage of those days.We left little either of thume or inclination to dwell upon aught save the horrid reality drama to others participated immediatelu in those great events.he daily vexations and annoyances--the hot and dusty day --the sleepless, anxious night--the rain upon the unsheltered bivouac--the dead lassitude which succeeded the excitement of action --the cruel orders which recognized no fatigue and made no allowance for labors undergone--all these small trials of the soldier's life made it possible to but few to realize the grandeur of the drama to which they were playing a part. Yet we were not wholly oblivious of it. Now and then I come across strange evidences of this in turning over the leaves of the few weather-stained, dogeared volumes which were the companions of my life in camp. The title page of one bears witness to the fact that it was my companion at Gettysburg, and in it I recently found some lines of Browning's noble poem of 'Saul' marked and altered to express my sense of our situation, and bearing date upon this very fifth of July. The poet had described in them the fall of snow in the springtime from a mountain, under which nestled a valley; the altering of a few words made them well describe the approach of our army to Gettysburg.

"Fold on fold, all at once, we crowded thundrously down to your feet; And there fronts yon, stark black but alive yet, your army of old With its rents, the successive bequeathing of conflicts untold. Yea, each harm got in fighting your battles, each furrow and scar Of its head thrust twixt you and the tempest--all hail, here we are."

And there we were, indeed, and then and there was enacted such a celebration as I hope may never again be witnessed there or elsewhere on another fourth of July.
