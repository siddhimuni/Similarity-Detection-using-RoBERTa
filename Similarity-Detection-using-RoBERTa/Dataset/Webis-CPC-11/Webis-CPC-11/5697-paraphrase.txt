This is the best process for all dark materials; in fact, this and the blue powder are all that will ever be needed. By this process a kind of paint is used instead of powder, and a brush instead of a pouncet. Place the pattern on the cloth, smooth side up if you can (though either side will work well), weight the pattern down as in stamping. Rub the paint evenly over the perforations, and it will leave the lines clean, sharp and distinct. After the stamping is done, the pattern must be cleaned immediately. We must take a quill with a fine point (a knitting needle will do nicely) and without leaning too hard go over all the outline of the engraving. We must be careful not to press your fingers on the engraving, as this would cause a deposit of powder the same color as the transferring paper on the writing paper. Now remove the transfer paper and you have the design accurately traced and the pattern is ready to be perforated.
This is done by a process known as pouncing. The process is as follows: Place the pattern (rough side up) on the material to be stamped, placing heavy weights on the corner to keep it from slipping; then rub the powder over the perforations with the pouncet or distributor described below till the pattern is clearly marked on the material.Then remove the pattern carefully, lay a piece of thin paper over the stamping and pass a hot iron over it.          To make a distributer, take a strip of fine felt almost an inch wide (a strip from an old felt hat is as good as anything), roll it up tightly into a roll, leaving the end flat, and rub the end over a piece of sand paper to make it smooth and even. 
To make a white powder,take one ounce white lead; half ounce gum arabic, in the impalpable powder; half ounce white rosin, in the fine powder. All well mixed.To make blue powder, take equal parts of gum damar and white rosin and just enough Persian blue to color it. Mix well together.  By this process a kind of paint is used instead of powder, and a brush instead of a pouncet. After the stamping is done, the pattern must be cleaned immediately.
