Weeds never stop growing. The Earth is filled with seeds, and stirring guides them to the warmth of the sun where they grow. Winter herbs will grow at any time, save extreme frost. In Winter, young trees and herbs will carry less snow and your alleys will be clean. Drifts of snow will allow deer and rabbits and other pests over your shrubs and walls and into your orchard. When summer comes, the gardener must dress the hedges and walls, tend to the bees, roses, and other plants. As the Summer fruit ripens you will wish to pick it. The gardener must have help in his endless work because no one man can tend to all of these things.

A gardener that will work quietly and patiently in your orchard will be rewarded with joy and God will make the rain fall upon their trees. He will provoke your love and earn his wages. He should be rewarded with what fruits and vegetables you have remaining to augment his wages.

If you cannot or will not hire a gardener you will keep all of the wages of the garden but you will do all of the work. I have performed this work and gathered these rules for the good of my countrymen.

Regarding soil

Some fruit trees common to our land include Apples, Pears, Cherries, Filberds, red and white Plums, Damsons, and Bulles. We should not bother with Apricots, peaches, or Quinces, as they do not suit our northern climate unless they are aided by reflecting the sun. We should avoid berry bushes, such as Barberies, Goose Berries, Raspberries. All require a well tempered soil to allow for best growth.

And then it turns into middle-english gibberish.
