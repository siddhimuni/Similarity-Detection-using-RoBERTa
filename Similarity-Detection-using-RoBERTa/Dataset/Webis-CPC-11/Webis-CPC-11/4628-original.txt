  JOHN GEYER.

  The City Gazette and Daily Advertiser, June 22, 1797.

20 DOLLARS REWARD

Ran-away from the Subscriber, on the evening of the 5th instant, a Negro Fellow named Lando;
he is about 5 feet 7 inches high, 18 or 19 years of age, remarkably likely Fellow, rather slim
made; HE SPEAKS FRENCH TOLERABLE WELL, and is too fond of the French Negroes, it is supposed
he is harboured by some of them. He had on when he went away a pair of brown trowsers, and
a jacket of the same colour, with green cape and cuffs and white metal buttons, but it is very
probable he may have changed his dress, as he carried other clothes with him.

A reward of Fifty Dollars will be paid to any person that will give information of his being
harbored by a White and Twenty-five Dollars if by a Black Person, on conviction of the offender.

  DAVID HAIG.

  City Gazette and Daily Advertiser (Charleston, S.C.), June 27, 1797.

TEN DOLLARS REWARD

Ran-away from his Master on the 6th ultimo, a MULATTO FELLOW named DICK, about 20 years old,
five feet nine or ten inches high; a stout well-built Fellow, SPEAKS ENGLISH VERY WELL. It
will be difficult to describe his dress, as he carried a quantity of clothing with him, when
he absented himself.

The above reward will be paid to whoever shall have secured him, so that he may be returned
to his Master.

Masters of vessels and all other persons are cautioned against harbouring said fellow, as they
will incur the penalties of the law in that case.
