In the beginning of spring season, it was on a bright breezy day in the realm of Dublin Castle.  We, the Lord Lieutenant's sister, Mrs. Arthur Henniker, with the help of whom he did the honours of the Castle and with whom I was acquainted in London, Mr. Fulke Greville and I were going for a walk around the curiously ancient buildings and courtyards which formed the area of Dublin Castle.

We could hear a military band playing opposite the main gate, and see them too.  There was a guard seated high above, who resembled the guard seated at St. James Fort.  It was an encouraging scene to its maximum.  We happened to come across the enormous Round Tower as we were walking through an arcade.  On the top of this tower, the Union Jack was floating.  it could be assumed that it dated back to a period of King John.  There was a chapel nearby called Chapel Royal.  It resembled the one at Windsor.  At this place we saw the guardian of the place.  He was a strange old man but very helpful and he was the one who was to guide us in the tour of the murky, but magnificent building.  
 He was very precise in his manner and he showed us the fourteenth century painted windows with pride.  We were also shown the special pews which meant for the King, where the women and men of the court were seated and the coats of arms which belonged to the several Governors from Ireland.  These were a century old, and he also showed us a thin ray of sunlight falling which appeared golden in color.  He said that it was the coat of arms of the Earl of Rochester.  He was also considered as a happy, amusing, evil and the regretful person.
