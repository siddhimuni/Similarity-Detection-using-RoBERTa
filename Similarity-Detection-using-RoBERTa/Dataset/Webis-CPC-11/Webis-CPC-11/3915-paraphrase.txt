Most commendable to American industry, the chance of being offered to duplicate, at the Testing Station, the conditions represented in a mine with gas, they showed an eagerness to modify and improve their explosives so as to enable them to answer severe mining conditions.

The same arguments may be used, in regard to the unfavorable conditions existing in mines in the past. In spite of high death rate and in spite of the frequency of mine accidents in the United States in cold mining as compared with that in other countries, it must be said in fairness that rather than any willful disregard of the known laws of safety by mine owners, this has been the result of ignorance of the actual conditions which produce mine explosions. American mine conditions are far different from those obtaining in mines abroad, and, as a result, the rules which years of experience had thought to foreign colliery managers were not quickly applied to conditions existing in American mines; but, as soon as the work at the Pittsburg Station has demonstrated the explosibility of the coal dust from adjoining mines, and had shown the very great safety of some explosives as compared with others. The mine owners at once are ready to improve the conditions in their mines and take advantage of all the studies made by the Government, thus showing clearly that the disasters of the past had been due to lack of sufficient information rather that to any willful disregard of the value of human lives.

Examination of explosives for the Panama Canal is another of the indirect benefits of the work of the Station. For several years the Isthmian Canal Commission has been one to the largest users of explosives in the world, and, in the purchase of the enormous quantities required. It was found necessary to establish a system of carful examination and inspection.
