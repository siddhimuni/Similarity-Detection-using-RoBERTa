(2.) Hellenes, connected with Helli, Selli, [Greek: selas, heulê, hêlios]. This derivation is made more probable {28} by the fact, that the neighbouring Pelasgic tribes have a similar meaning; e.g.,

Perrhæbi, alike to Pyrrha and [Greek: pur]; Æthices, [Greek: aithô], Tymphæi, [Greek: tuphô]; Hestiæi, [Greek: hestia].

Add to this, that the name Phthiotis seems indubitably to derive its name from Phthah, the Egyptian Hephæstus, and to be a translation of the word Hellas.

N.B.--The existence of an Egyptian colony in that part is attested by the existence of a Phthiotic Thebæ.

(3.) On the other hand, the word Achæus seems to be connected with [Greek: achos, achnumai], and [Greek: achlus] in the sense of gloom (of [Greek: ouranion achos]).

So the Homeric Cimmerians are derived from [Hebrew: KIMRIYRIY] (Job), denoting darkness.

(4.) Lastly, I submit with great diffidence the following examination of the words Dorus and the Æolian Minyæ, which I shall attempt to derive from words denoting sun and moon respectively.

The word Dorus I assume to be connected with the first part of the names Dry-opes and Dol-opes. The metathesis in the first case seems sanctioned by the analogy of the Sanscrit drî and Greek [Greek: deirô], and the mutation of l and r in the second is too common in Greek and Latin to admit of any doubt, e.g. [Greek: ar-galeos] and [Greek: algaletos]; Sol and Soracte. With this premised, I think we may be justified in connecting the following words with each other.
