The picture will be known as "Grace before Meals," delightfully (of course) painted by Sir
JOHN E. MILLAIS.

No. 232. By the P.R.A. "What's that?" said one well-educated clerical visitor to his matronly
wife. She read it out, pronouncing it thusly, "Return of Percy Fone." "What!" exclaimed the
Clergyman. Then, taking the Catalogue into his own hands, he read "Return of Persephone." "It's
pronounced," he informed his help-mate, "PÃ«r-s[)e]ph-[)o]-n[)e]." "Is it?" she returned, in
a tone expressive of unmitigated incredulity. "Then," she asked suddenly, as a brilliant idea
struck her, "why isn't 'telephone' pronounced 'tel-[)e]ph-[)o]-n[)e]'?" And turning her back
on him, would not hear another word on the subject.

No. 283. Not Crossley, but Kindly. CLAUDE CALTHROP.

No. 390. A Boy to the very life, or a Life Boy. JAMES SANT, R.A. It's a picture of Master HUGH

to see the Hue of health on his cheek is better than seeing the colour of that HUGH'S money.

an impetuous and irrepressible "Hang it!" "I will," replied the Artist, JOHN PETTIE, R.A.
