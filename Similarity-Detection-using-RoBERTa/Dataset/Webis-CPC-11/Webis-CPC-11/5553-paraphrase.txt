Society moves in cycles, like the planets move in orbits.  Popular clothes or music styles from the 70s were not popular in the 80s, but we see remnants and mimics of them in today's society.  Some call it "coming back in to style".  Bell bottoms are now called flare jeans and "hippy" shirts are now called tunics.  The peace sign was also back in style recently.  Hair bands were re-invented as emo or indie bands.

Prom is vaguely reminiscent of a young girl's coming out party.  Meet ups for book readings or coffee is similar to getting together for tea and socializing.

Because of this, we can conclude that readers would enjoy Professor Schlosser's survey of high society folk who lived in the last century in Europe.  Schlosser is a Professor of History at the University of Heidelberg.  He is mainly known for the History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth until the fall of the French Empire.  He draws his information from previously unexamined sources and literature of the great European nations.  This time was a period of great history because of the new discoveries, innovations, and events that transpired.  The arts and sciences were greatly advanced during this time, which enhanced the prosperity of nations.

If we try to compare the Parisian evening, dinner and supper parties with the general history of Europe, taking into account the ladies who hosted these parties, we cannot be too harsh or too soft.  To truly inform the public about how life was in this time period, we must be honest and truthful.  We also must take in to account the setting at which these events occured.  It was before the women's suffrage movement in the USA, and cannot be viewed the same way as we look at today's society.
