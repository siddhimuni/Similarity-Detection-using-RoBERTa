In the fresh spring-like hut, I drew my stocking on my delicate leg and saw a star in the depths of the garret. Even though I have read a great deal of Plato, I remember nothing about it. He was better than Malebranche and Lamennais who demonstrated to me a celestial goodness with a flowering gift. I obeyed him and he submitted to me, oh gilded garret! To embrace and behold you going and coming from dawn in my chemise and gazing at your young brow in your ancient mirror. Who then would fore go the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament of flowers, gauze, and moire? Perhaps when love stammers a charming slang? Even our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips and you masked the window with my your petticoat. IOh the misfortunes that made us laugh when I took the earthenware bowl and gave you the Japanese cup. Your cuff was scorched and your boa was lost and that dear portrait of the divine Shakespeare that we sold one evening simply so would could eat! I was a beggar and you were charitable. I kissed your fresh round arms in haste and A folio Dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily with fortunes worth of chestnuts. For the first time in my joyous den, I snatched a kiss from your fiery lip. You went forth dishevelled and blushing while I turned deathly pale and believed in God. Do you remember our all those fichus changing to rags and our innumerable joys?
