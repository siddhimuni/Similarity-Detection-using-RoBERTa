We find that our friends do not often ask for so-called miracles or marvels
to prove the genuineness of the Adepts' powers.  But they ask why the Adepts will not give
some proof--not necessarily that they are far beyond us, but that their knowledge does at least
equal our own in the familiar and definite tracks which Western science has worn for itself.
A few pregnant remarks on Chemistry,--the announcement of a new electrical law, capable of
experimental verification--some such communication as this (our interlocutors say), would arrest
attention, command respect, and give a weight and prestige to the higher teaching which, so
long as it remains in a region wholly unverifiable, it can scarcely acquire.

We gratefully recognize the very acceptable choice which the Adepts have made in selecting
Mr. Sinnett as the intermediary between us and them. They could hardly have chosen any one
more congenial to our Western minds:--whether we consider the clearness of his written style,
the urbanity of his verbal expositions, or the earnest sincerity of his convictions.  Since
they have thus far met our peculiar needs with such considerate judgment, we cannot but hope
that they may find themselves able yet further to adapt their modes of teaching to the requirements
of Occidental thought.

It was not in contemplation, at the outset of the work begun in Fragments, to deal as fully
with the scientific problems of cosmic evolution as now seems expected.
