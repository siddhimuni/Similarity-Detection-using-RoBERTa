Everlasting debates of Lincoln and Douglas in 1858 were never put into a book until 1860, previously only available in newspaper print. Newspapers are sometimes important in determining a date and place to set a man. If, for example, a successful writer draws an inference from the fact said that President Lincoln went to see Edwin Booth played Hamlet in Washington in February 1863, and if one finds a consulting newspaper ads Edwin Booth Theatre, which has visited Washington during the same month, meaning inference is destroyed. Lincoln General Scott paid a memorable visit to West Point in June, 1862. Might, if I remember correctly, search books in vain to reach the exact date of this visit, but in turn, newspaper files and you find that the president left Washington so at such a day, arrived in Jersey City said at one point and made the transfer to other railroads that took him across the station at West Point. Its time to leave West Point and at his return from Washington, are also given.

The value of newspapers as an indication of public sentiment is sometimes questioned, but may be hard put to doubt that the average man read the newspaper with feelings that he agrees. "I asked the opinion of the newspaper," said Joseph Chamberlain in the House of Commons in May last year. "I knew no other way to get the popular opinion." During the years between 1854 and 1860 daily journals have been a pretty good reflection of public sentiment in the United States. Whenever, for example, have found the New York Weekly Tribune, read in part, a majority of Republicans were sure to be had when election day came. Fact and opinion, if you knew contributors, and editorial statements that they have the right to be weight than similar public expressions, in any form. You know Greeley and learn to recognize his style.
