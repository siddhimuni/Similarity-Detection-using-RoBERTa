Maitland finally reached the Paddington, still he is asking questions. He had telegraphed  before night to inquire whether two persons answering to the oft-repeated description, had been noticed at the terminus. He had received a reply in the negative before leaving Tiverton. . If the ticket-collector want  to be credited, the objects of his research    had reached Westbourne Park, where their tickets had been taken.
There, however, all the evidence proved that they had not descended. Nobody had seen them alight Yet, not a trace was to be found at Paddington of a gentleman in a fur coat, nor of any gentleman travelling alone with a young lady.

It was nearly nine o'clock when Maitland, puzzled, worn out, and disgusted, arrived in town.
