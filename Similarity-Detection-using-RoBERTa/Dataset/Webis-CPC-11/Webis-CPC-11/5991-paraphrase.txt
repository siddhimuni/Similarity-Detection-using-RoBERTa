All the atmosphere degrees is high,It also dark and  fantly the  whether around.Everywhere was comfusing,As i thaught there was problem.both the light and darkness still emerged itself till morning by the degree going higher to complete the separation.
The stars was chased out of the cloud.The forest was covered with darkness that to view it seem to be a monster hidden.Now appear a rays of the sun sun,catching life and beauty from every increasing beam. As the scens comes larger the horizon expands and widens itself every corners.When the sun appears to the view of every indivduals from the east. the light covers the world.All appears pleasant.like a new heaven.The senses which was not known to such objects are bewildered and confounded;not too far ,they are capable of separating and judging them.Yes the body of the sun seem to rising from the depth of the ocean.immense track both of the sea and land intervening;various areas appears under your feet.you look down the whole sicily as on a map,which can trace every river from its source.To conclude the matter is that there is no where to find out the mouth of all these phenomena, even from the voyage can prove the coasts of Africa and even the Greece,as they are above the horizon.Time's Telescope.
