"He is making a kite."
"He?" - asked Joe Myers - "He is a grown man, what does he know about kites?"

"Anyway, he is comming now."

They went to the bars and looked, but yet no one has risen his kite.

"Wow, what a kite!" 
"It is tall as he is!"
"No, it isn't. It looks like because he is carrying it on his shoulders."
"It's an awful kite..."

Sim Vedder,was a thin man who works for Dr. Gay. So thin was his face too, his hooked nose had a queer twist in it half way to the point.

He was trying to get away from the enormous kite and and was comming towards us.

All the boys wanted to ask something, but they kept still because they didn't know what to ask.

"Are you kiting? First, just let me to take a look at your kites, and then you may look at mine. One at a time. You made that kite by yourself Parley?" 

"Yes, I made it."

"I guess there was plenty of wood around your house. Your kite is two feet high, mine is five, but despite that your sticks are bigger than mine"

He turned the kite its face back and they saw the framework, which was made of plenty slender slips and looked like ash or hickory wood.

"Mine is pine made", said Parley. "Yours will brake too." 

"No, it won't. Maybe yours will fly. Set it, there is plenty of wind."

Parley setted the kite and because of the wind it began to go up.

"Joe! Hand me your kite." said Sim Vedder.

"Mine is d'imond, I don't know how to make other."

"Do you think taht it will stand steady, with those fore-bands so close together? No. See how it will wiggle. Bob Jones, is that kite yours?" 

He handed the kite to him. The boys were starring at Sim's big kite, and they believed in his words.

"It's not a bad kite, but the fore-bands are crossed to low, probably it will just dive.

"Sim, there is a big tail, it cant dive!"

"Tail, with a May weed at its end... How can that big kite lift? I'll show you" replied Sim

He crossed the fore-bands over his little finger, and replaced them until the kite swung under them.
