The pentagonal impression of the outer is due towards the fragment of a cheaper tower which once leaned against it, and presumably formed the peak of a wing operating out from the old castle of the Burggrafs. The Burggr√§fliche Burg stood beneath, according towards Mummenhof, southwest and west of this point. It was burned down within 1420, and the impaired remains of it are assumed towards be traceable within the eminence, already overgrown via turf and trees, across which a type of ravine, finished within onto either side via built-up walls, has just carried ourselves from the town towards the Vestner Thor. 
The Burggraf's Castle would appear towards possess been so situated as towards protect the strategy towards the Imperial Castle (Kaiserburg). The perfect extent of the former we can not already determine. Meisterlin refers towards it as a little fort. We may, however, be certain that it reached from the Five-cornered tower towards the Walpurgiskapelle. For this little chapel, east of the park branded the Freiung, is continually spoken of as being onto the premises of the Burggrafs. Besides their castle proper, which was held at former as a fief of the Empire, and thereafter arrived towards be regarded as their hereditary, independent premises, the Burggrafs were also entrusted with the holding of a tower which led the door towards the Castle rock onto the nation side, possibly alongside the spot of the show Vestner Thor. The defender door may possess been roped towards the tower, the lower allocation of which remains towards this day, and is branded the Bailiff's Dwelling (Burgamtmannswohnung). The perfect correlation of the Burggraf towards the town onto the one hand, and towards the Empire onto the else, is quite obscure. Originally, it would appear, he was merely an Imperial officer, governing Imperial estates, and glancing as soon as Imperial interests.
