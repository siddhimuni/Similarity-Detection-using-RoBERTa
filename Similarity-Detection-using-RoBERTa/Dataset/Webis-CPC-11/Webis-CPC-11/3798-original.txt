The fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most bigoted idolizers of State authority
have not thus far shown a disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime
causes. These so generally depend on the laws of nations, and so commonly affect the rights
of foreigners, that they fall within the considerations which are relative to the public peace.
The most important part of them are, by the present Confederation, submitted to federal jurisdiction.

The reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in which the State tribunals
cannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks for itself. No man ought certainly to be a judge
in his own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias. This
principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts as the proper tribunals
for the determination of controversies between different States and their citizens. And it
ought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same State.
Claims to land under grants of different States, founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary,
are of this description. The courts of neither of the granting States could be expected to
be unbiased. The laws may have even prejudged the question, and tied the courts down to decisions
in favor of the grants of the State to which they belonged. And even where this had not been
done, it would be natural that the judges, as men, should feel a strong predilection to the
claims of their own government.
