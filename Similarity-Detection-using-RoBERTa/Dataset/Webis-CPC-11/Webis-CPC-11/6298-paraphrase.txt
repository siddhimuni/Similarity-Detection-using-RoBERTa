Jane found a "way out" and with her departure from this life my interest in the book evaporated. I  am not going to tell you exactly what happened, but Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY has notable gifts as a descriptive writer, and my only complaint against her is that vulgar Jane was not allowed to live, for in the Army or out of it she was worth a whole platoon of John-Andrews. I may add the Vagueners, were not a little mad, but then they were Cornish, and novelists persist in treating Cornwall as if it were a contact details of duchy.

 I can't  recommend Mr. HUGH ELLIOT'S volume on Herbert Spencer (CONSTABLE) for light reading,  at the age of thirty-six, and may be kindled at the later picture of a middle-aged sportsman shinning effectively, after a Neapolitan who had squeezed his opera-glasses. Fine human traits these  a character which will strike the normal man as bewilderingly characteristic of all living beings. The flippant reader, tackling Mr. ELLIOT'S analyses, may get an impression of sticking to an opinion of sensational,  with all manner of reasoned-out "inventions" at his saddle-bow,of heterogeneous  or homogeneous types etc which don't seem, as helpful as their inventor assumes.  He took tosses into many of the pits of his dangerous deductive method. I don't present this as Mr. ELLIOT'S view. He is respectful-critical, and makes perhaps the best case for his old master SPENCER himself claim to greatness of the assumption that,  enemy to authority and dogmatism, would have preferred his biographer's critical examination to any mere masters obedient reproduction of Spencerian doctrine.

No one seen the title can complain after having the course of the narrative, Miss F.E. MILLS YOUNG'S new story has at least this much merit about it. That is  having discovered in the opening chapters a sufficiently charming Pamela living in perpetual honeymoon with a partner rich, good-looking and with no particular occupation to interfere with unlimited motor trips and dinner parties. We may imagine the tale was going to remain a jolly meaningless thing, and so have been as much shocked as the heroine herself on reading the fatal letter.The book to be called straight out The Bigamist (LANE), have no difficulty in foreseeing the emergence other wife from the  past ready to pounce down on poor little Pam at her happiest.She duly appeared with the buried past. Such happiness never last long, the man was flatly a cur, not deserving  foolish women he managed to attract. There were three of them-do not deserve attention. Now,I  leave the rest to perusal or imagination.  The conclusion has something of dignity that does a little to redeem the volume.
