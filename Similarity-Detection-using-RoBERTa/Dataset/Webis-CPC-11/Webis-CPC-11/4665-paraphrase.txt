capital are the best of many anecodotes and his ecclesiastical patronage.dating the letter from no.2, charlotte street, pimlico, the chancellor's eldest son sent an anonymous epistle:-

"hear,generous lawyer!nor let my freedom make, you stare, in hailing you jack scott! tho'now upon the woolsack placed with wealth,power, and little graced.a starving priest some little living.the world will cry out well done

in vain, without a patron's aid,l've prayed and preached.such vain eclat let others share,alas, I cannot feed on air .prettier and less comic is the story of miss bridge's morning call upon lord eldon. sje is a lovley girl.bridge of weobly, the daughter of the vicar of weoblyand papa has sent me to remind you of promise which you made hin when i was alittle baby.he is trying ti recall how he had pledged himself that if ever you are lord chancellor, when my little girl is apoor clergy man's wife

enthusiastically the chancellor exclamied,"you are quite right.i admit the obligation.
