Dr. Franklin said that the Kite draws lightning from the clouds, but that this should be the proud prerogative of the American Eagle, the most noble falcon, who is oftedn seen with a flashing of talons, rushing through the skies as lightning.  
The Eagle feeds on inferior birds, but primarily upon the American Bunting, who it carries through the sky within its powerful jaws.  It is od that its feats with electrical fluid and its fondness for the Bunting have not be noted by the great naturalists.  However, the ommision has not stopped depictions by innumerable artists of the snatching of one and the act of scattering the other.

The original habitat of the Birdoffreedom was limited to about 12 degrees latitude, but given its tendency to roam, like the now extinct Imperial Eagle of Italy, within the last fifty years, its feeding grounds have grown significantly.  It can now be found as far North as the Border of the Arctic Sea, where it has befriended the hyperborean humming bird.  Professor Grant is currently attempting to naturalize it in Saint Domingo.  Soon it will probably travel to roost on the equator.  On the whole, it is a grasping bird who inspire the weaker tribes with terror.  But fierceness notwithstanding, it perches with familiarity of the Arms of the American people.

Although is appearance is magnificent in all seasons, the Birdofreedom is the most beautiful near the Fourth of July, when its feathers are the most full.  It is then that its disposition is manifested in a threatening attitude toward the Anglo-Saxon Lion (Leo Britannicus) who it has twice bested in head on combat, and to whose compact and strong frame it is prepared to administer a third sockdologer.
