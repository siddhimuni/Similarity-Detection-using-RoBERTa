It is true that inventions or discoveries are sometimes the result of accident or chance, but in the vast majority of cases, they are the result of careful planning and preparation.  Ideas must be examined, analyzed, and modified in great detail until they reach their fruition.  There is always an element of chance or uncertainty in any experiment, but generally there must be careful thought and purpose behind any succesful effort.

Among scientists and working researchers, these ideas are familiar and commonplace.  They have also begin to spread to the general public.  So if mankind is to have a better understanding of physical forces, it must experiment and work systematically towards understanding.  This means the careful measuring, describing, classifying and analyzing of every solid, liquid, gas, and so on.  It also applies to living beings, plants, animals, and even humans.  Yet what about social structures, our institutions, our governments?  Here there is a hesitation about whether it is possible to use the scientific method.  Is there any other way to gain knowledge?

We must answer unequivocally that there is no other way to gain knowledge.  The only way to learn about society itself is through experimentation, the use of systematic trial and error methods.  In fact, this is the way that progress is made, even if it is not done intentionally.  History is the record of all such experiments conducted on human society.  Even if they are not planned, they are still observations that provide explanations about human behavior, such as our family relationships, religious, political, and educational institutions.
