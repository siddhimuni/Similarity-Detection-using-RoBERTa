Non-commissioned officers are given married quarters, but privates are not. American barracks may lead to a higher class of recruit than usual because they are designed well and have better internal finishing. A separate block system is frequently used to arrange barracks, centered around a post-exchange or soldier's club. This is a building that serves as a gym, recreation area, and seargeants' mess, as well has having an attached bath-house. In 1901, they stopped having canteens that sold liquor.

Joachim Barrande (born 1799, died 1883) was a geologist and paleontologist from Austria. He was born August 11, 1799, in Saugues, Haute Loire. He attended school in Paris at Ecole Polytechnique. 

He was trained as an engineer but started working as a tutor to Charles X's grandson, the duc de Bordeaux, who was later called the comte de Chambord. In 1830, King Charles abdicated, and Barrande went with the royal exiles to England, Scotland, and later Prague. In 1831, he decided to stay in Prague and started doing engineering work. Then he got interested in fossils from Lower Palaeozoic rocks in Bohemia. In 1839, Murchison published a Silurian System that prompted Barrande to do similar systematic research on Bohemian strata.
