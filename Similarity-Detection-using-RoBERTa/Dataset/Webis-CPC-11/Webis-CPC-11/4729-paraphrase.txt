I recently heard about him.  A few of them are there."

"I assume you will meet them on your trip to the North?"

"Definitely, though the place smells bad but looks good.  Plus, there's always whiskey."

"When are you travelling?"

"Probably within a couple of weeks."

Lavender went home that night early without mentioning anything else about his plans.  He packed, wrote an interesting letter to his aunt, and slept a bit.

When he woke, he walked down to the Gore through the Kensington Gardens.  He was hoping to see Sheila.  Perhaps he could see her on an errand, since she liked to bring letters to the post.  Hopefully, before he left London he could see her face.

Some people were out, including some lawyers and merchants.  As he watched, shops were opening.  The house was near, covered in ivy, tiny windows with proper red curtains, dark bricks covering the front.  Certainly, that beautiful princess Sheila must be inside.  Sheila was from the sea and the rocks, but where were they?  Where were the foersts, the waves, and the sands?  How sad and strange that as Lavender was to head North into that strong, salty air and mountain winds, Sheila the nature-woman was holed up in the city.   If only he could speak with her, she could forgive what he did and run away from London and those toxic ties, to be with him in the Hebrides.

He knew that Sheila was walking to the house.  He had noticed too late, so he could not get out of her way.  Yet, he couldn't do as he wished and simply speak with her.  She saw him.  She pretended not to.
