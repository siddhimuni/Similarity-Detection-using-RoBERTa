Instead of trying to develop some  moral sense in the little creature, sale mina asked her to alternate roses and oleanders with poppies in her  a coral comb and earings on her birthday. Thus does a warm climate undermine the strict virtue engendered by Boston east winds


Francesco-casco for short-is general assistant in the kitchen,and good gondolier to boot.When our little family is increased by more than three guests at dinner,Casco is pressed into dining-room service,and becomes under-butler to pepping.Here he is not at ease he scrubs his tanned face until it shines like San Domimgo mahogany,brushes his black hair until the gloss resembles a varnish,and dons coarse ehite cotton gloves to conceal his work-stained hands and give anair of fashion and elegence to the banquet.His embarrassment is equalled only by his
earnestness and devotion to the dreaded task.
Our American guests do not care what we have upon our bill of fare when they can steal a glance at the intensely dramatic and impassioned Casco taking pine into a corner of the dining-room and,seizing her hand despairingly endeavour to find out his next duty.Then with incredibly stiff back,he extends his right hand to the guest,as if the proffered plate held a scorpion instead of a titbit.There is an extra butler to be obtained when the function is a sufficiently grand one to warrent the expense,but as he wears carpet slippers and pine flirts with him from soup to fruit,we find ourselves no better served on the whole, and prefer Casco,since he transforms an ordinary meal in to a beguiling comedy.

"What does it matter after all?" asks sale mina."It is not life we are living,for the moment,but an act of light opera,with the scenes all beautifully painted,the music charming and melodious,the costumes gay and picturesque.We are occupying expectionally good seats,and we have no responsibility whatever:we left it in Boston,where it is probablyrolling itself larger and larger,like a snowball;but who cares?"

"Who cares,indeed?"I echo.We are here not to form our characters or to improve our minds,but to let them relax;and when we see anything which opposes the Byronic ideal of Venice(the use of the concentrina as the national instrument having this tendancy),we delibrately close our eyes to it.I have a proper regard for truth in matters of fact like statistics.I want to know the exact population of atown,the precise total of children of school age,the number of acres in the Yellowstone Park,and the amount of wheatexported in 1862;but when it comes to things touching my imagination I resent the intrusion of some laboriously excavated truth,after my point of view is all nicelly setteled,and my saints,heroes,and martyrs are all comfortably arranged in their respective niches or on their proper pedestals.

When the man of Fact demolishes some pretty fallacy like William Tell and the apple,he should be required to substitute somthing equally delightfull and more authentic.Buthe never does.He is a useful but uninteresting creature, the man of Fact,and for a travelling companion or a neighbour at dinner give me the Man of Fancy, even if he has not a grain of exact knowledge concealed about his person.It seems to me highly important that the foundations of Glasgow,Birmingham,Manchester,or Spokane Falls should be rooted in certainly;but verona,padua and Venice-well,in my opinion,they shouls be rooted in Byron and Ruskin and Shakespeare.

CASA ROSA,May 18

Such a fanfare of bells as greeted our ears on the morning of our first awakening Casa Rosa!


"Rise at once and dress quickly,Sale mina!"I said."Either an heir has been born to the throne,or a foreign Crown Prince has come to visit Venice,or perhaps  a Papal Bull is loose in the Piazza San Marco.Whatever it is,we must not miss it,as i am keeping a diary."
