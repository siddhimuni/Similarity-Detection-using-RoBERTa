A curious parallel movement towards extremes went on simultaneously in
the two camps. While Burke separated himself from Fox, split the Whig party, and devoted his
genius to the task of fanning the general English dislike of the Revolution into a panic rage
of anger and fear, the progressive camp in its turn was gradually captured by the "intellectuals,"
and passed from a humdrum demand for political reform into a ferment of moral and social speculation.
Societies grew up in all the chief centres of population, always with the same programme. "An
honest Parliament. An annual Parliament. A Parliament wherein each individual will have his
representative." Of these the most active, the most extreme, and the best organised was undoubtedly
the London Corresponding Society.

It was founded by a Scottish boot-maker named Thomas Hardy. The sober, limited character of
the man is plain to read in his records and pamphlets. The son of a sea-captain, who had had
his education in a village school in Perthshire where the scholars paid a penny a week, he
was a leading member of the Scots' Kirk in Covent Garden, and had drawn his political education
not at all from godless French philosophers, but from the Protestant fanatic, Lord George Gordon,
and from Dr. Price's book on the American War. He gathered his own friends together to found
his society, and nine of them met for the first time in the "Bell" tavern in Exeter Street
in January, 1792. "They had finished their daily labour and met there by appointment. After
having their bread and cheese and porter for supper, as usual, and their pipes afterwards,
with some conversation, on the hardness of the times and the dearness of all the necessaries
of life, which they in common with their fellow-citizens felt to their sorrow, the business
for which they had met was brought forward--Parliamentary Reform."
