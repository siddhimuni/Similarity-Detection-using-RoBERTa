The author has submitted to pressures of about 20,000 atmospheres metals which possess this property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, and he finds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase of density, its repetition makes little difference. 

 Their density is found to have reached a maximum. Hence the density of solids, like that of liquids, is only really modified by temperature. Pressure effects no permanent condensation of solid bodies, except they are capable of assuming an allotropic condition of greater density. The author's former researches tend to show that solid matter, in suitable conditions of temperature, takes the state corresponding to the volume which it is compelled to occupy. Hence there is an analogy between the allotropic states of certain solids and the different states of aggregation of matter. Possibly the different forms of matter may be due to a single cause--polymerization. The limit of elasticity of a solid body is the critical moment when the matter begins to flow under the action of the pressure to which it is submitted, just as, e.g., ice at or below 0 deg. may be liquefied by strong pressure. A brittle body is simply one which does not possess the property of flowing under the action of pressure.

 HYDROGEN AMALGAM. 

 Hydrogen, although a gas, is recognized by chemists as a metal, and when combined with any solid metal--as in the case known to electricians as the polarization of a negative element,--the compound may correctly be termed an alloy; while any compound of hydrogen with the fluid metal mercury may with equal correctness be termed an amalgam of hydrogen, or "hydrogen amalgam." 

 The efforts of many chemists and mining engineers have for many years been devoted to a search for some effective and economical means for preventing the "sickening" of mercury and its consequent "flouring" and loss.
