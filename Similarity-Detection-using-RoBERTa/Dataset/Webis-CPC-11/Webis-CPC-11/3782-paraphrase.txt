believe that his is a summary of the history of all our commercial disasters, stripped of the local and incidental circumstances may change from time to time: too much about money - speculative prosperity - all the world to get rich in the the most pleasant way, - fairy palaces rise everywhere, without the sound of trowel or a hammer, then - the day of adjustment - the rapid contraction of the currency - everyone getting poor in the most drastic and how unpleasant - and the palaces of fairy tales, which rose well above our eyelids of the night, disappearing, as the palace of Aladdin's vision of the Grand-Seignior then awoke in the morning. But, alas! the repulsion does not end with the overthrow of the palaces that had been bred out of work, not satisfied with the dissipation of mere fantasies and dreams, but being in itself a real thing, which involves many an imposing structure, the fatigue, the economy, the devotion of years had barely raised. extraneous causes, - a short crop, - a reduced rate - a peculiar hobby business - can accelerate or retard the various steps in the process has been described, but their cause and their training is almost always the same, and discerning eye can easily detect them, from the beginning to the end of our modern commercial experience. In the existing difficulties in this country, the railway speculation has had much to do with the production and worsen the effect, but the main source of which, we believe, lies in the ease with which inflates our currency, under a banking system, which varies from state to state, and, outside New England and New York, where it is not perfect, is so clumsy a contrivance for the purpose to answer, as has been inflicted on both the patience of the humanity.
