Isabella's father went by the nickname of "Bomefree' which is low Dutchfor tree because when he was young he was very tall and straight. This was SOJOURNER's way to pronounce it so he usually went by this name.The most familiar nickname of her mother was"Mau-mau Bett'She had some ten or maybe twelve children but Sojoumer doesn't know for sure the exact number of her sisters and brothers. She was the youngest except for one and all the older ones had been sold before she was old ebough to remember.She was grateful to know six of them when she was a slave.

There was a boy of five years and a girl of six who were the closest to her in age and they were sold when she was a baby.She wished that all people who believed that slave parents did not have affection for their own children could have listened to Bomefree and Mau-mau Bett tell their endearing stories of the children they had who were gone.They would sit for hours in their dark cellar only lighted by a burning pine knot and recall the good and also the harrowing stories of these children's lives while they were with them. One particular story was of their little son who woke up early the last morning he was with them and started a fire before waking up Mau-mau Bett.The child couldn't know the awful seperation that would soon take place but his parents had the foreboding feeling of what would be taking place.This morning there was snow on the ground and a large sleigh had drove up to the door of the late Col. Ardinburgh's house.Not knowing what to expect the children were at first delighted. Happiness turned to horror for the boy when he saw his his little sister shut and locked in the sleigh box and he himself was forced into the sleigh. His little eyes were opened to what was going on so he jumped and ran into the house and hid himself under the bed.
