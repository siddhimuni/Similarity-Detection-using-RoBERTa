Anyone could build a piano in four months or so, but it would never reach the quality of mass-produced pianos.  People rarely try this in the United States, anyway.  Small-time piano makers, making about five a week, buy parts from part-makers to assemble into a full insturment.  There are makers of specific parts of a piano: the action, the keys, the legs, the cases, and the pedals.  These business are entirely seperate from the final producers, though equally important.

The London Directory has fourty-two businesses and trades related to pianos, and there undoubtedly about the same in New York City.  Therefore, anyone in the United States who knows enough about pianos and can get the money required can build pianos and call himself a panio-builder.  The problem: Selling the pianos.  It currently costs more to sell one than make one.

Upon completion of the case, with the exception of the finish, the piano is taken to a sounding-board room.  The sounding-board is a thin clear spruce sheet that rests under the strings and gives the piano its voice.  Without it, the piano has no life.  People have tried a plethora of materials for the sounding board, but nothing rivals spruce.  People are constantly trying to improve the quality of a sounding board, adjusting the shape, arrangement, thickness, and other properties of it--trying to one-up the competition.

After this, the strings go in.  Then, the action and keys.
