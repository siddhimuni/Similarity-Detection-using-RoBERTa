Was it possible that the medical authority was right? Unless the doctor was skilled in comparative anatomy, those bones might easily have been those of an sheep buried in the cellar by some canny canine.

The house, which recently stood or perhaps even still stands on Washington street, was built by the nefarious sea captain, Captain Kidd. 

Kidd, after a long absence returned to the town a wealthy man. It was rumored that he acquired his fortune through piracy or the slave-trade. It was said that his young house-keeper disappeared about the same time as the captain.

The story I am telling is as authentic as a second hand story can be. My source was the talented Mrs. M. This worldly and cultured Englishwoman was exemplary morally and completely trustworthy. She was, in fact, so fond of the story that she told it in verse.

There is another ghost story on the same street of that town. It seems the town, was once haunted by spirits and such, but modernization seems to have run them all away.

I once lived in Newport in a "turn of the century" house built by a retired sea-captain. There were no ghost stories, no tales of horror connected to this house. I lived in the house peacefully until one snowy winter's day, around one in the afternoon, we heard a terrible commotion in the kitchen. We ran into the kitchen to find the cook, Martha, flustered and afraid. When she pulled herself together, she gasped "There was a face in the window!". I ran outside immediately and checked for a trespasser, but there was none. There were no footprints anywhere in the snow.

Upon further questioning, it seems Martha had recognized the face as that of her child who was raised by another woman in another state.
