A receptacle,
very similar to that used at the breaker card, appears near the far end of the softening machine
in Fig. 13.

A modern breaker card is illustrated in Fig. 14. The feed or back of the card is on the extreme
right, the delivery or front of the card on the extreme left, while the gear side of the card
is facing the observer. The protecting cages were removed so that the wheels would be seen
as clearly as possible.

Some of the stricks of fibre are seen distinctly on the feed side of the figure; they are accommodated,
as mentioned, in a channel-shaped stand on the far side of the inclined feed sheet, or feed
cloth, which leads up to and conveys the stricks into the grip of the feeding apparatus. This
particular type is termed a "shell" feed because the upper contour of the guiding feed bracket
is shaped somewhat like a shell. There is a gradually decreasing and suitably-sized gap between
the upper part of the shell and the pins of the feed roller.

The root ends of the pins in this roller lead, and the stricks of fibre are gripped between
the pins and the shell, and simultaneously carried into the machine where they come into contact
with the points of the pins in the rapidly-revolving large roller, termed a cylinder. The above-mentioned
combing and splitting action takes place at this point as well as for a distance of, say, 24
inches to 30 inches below.
