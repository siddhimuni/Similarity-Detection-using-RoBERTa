There were thousands of cavalry in the field, and the fight, dubbed "exceeding wild and impressive," last from 9 AM to 5 PM. The British were most impressive in display; the people carrying guns with which they were well acquainted. Only but an engine, the "brass galloper" was viewd with great respect, and its rocket a fantastic novelty. Dusk finally came, and at the king's command, rocket fire began and created quite the spectacle. Everyone was amazed and frightened. People fell to the ground, and the horses and mules broke free from their leashes. The Galla tribes attributed the rocket phenomenon to "strong medicines," and stated that the British, whom they referred to as "Gyptzis," had control over the comets that crash to Earth. There was no other option for the tribe than to surrender to the British king.

Three times in a year, the king sent his military on a mission into nearby lands, as he wished to establish embassies in these locations. The militia accepted the offer, as it was the best way to see the country. In reality, they had no intention of fully participating in the marauding expedition, we cannot judge their silence in going along with the plan. They had not the authority to help out the king of Shoa in his attack on his neighbors, moreso than assisting the king's neighbors' attacks on the king.

The march was odd, with an air of pretention, led by someone holding the Holy Bible under a scarlet drape, atop of a donkey. The belief was that having the "ark of the cathedral of St. Michael" would ensure victory for them. The king, along with his personal guards, was followed by a extremely long line parade of women, cooks, and horsemen, all of whom were being protected by troops. It was an impressive sight! The march lasted for 15 miles, after which the lady cooks halted in a beautiful, quiet valley. Evidentally, the march had come to an end that day, and the parade made preparations for the night.
