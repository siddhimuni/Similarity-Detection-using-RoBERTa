Whatever dreadful shock may be in reserve for my declining years, I am certain that I canbear it, for I went through that scene at Snowborough, and still live!

When the garments were fully displayed, everyone looked at me. I had been to college; I had studied Burke's Peerage; I had been once to New York. Perhaps I could immediately name the exact station in noble British life to which suits the cloth I belonged. I could see all at a glance. I grew flustered and pale. I dared not look my poor deluded female relatives in the face.

"What rank in the peerage do these gold-laced garments and big buttons betoken?" cried all three.

"It is a suit of servant's livery!"gasped I, and fell back with a shudder.

That evening, after the had gone down, we buried those hateful garments ina ditch at the bottom of the garden. Rest there perturbed body-coat, yellow trousers, brown gaiters, and all!

"Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!"
WHY MOLES HAVE HANDS

One day the children came running to Aunt Nancy with a mole which one of the dogs had just killed. They had never seen one before and were very curious as to what it might be.

"Wel, befo' de King!" said Nancy, "whaty'all bin living that you nuver seed a mole before?

I bin most all over dish yes Susses country entering my time and I aim never come accross no place yet what day iain have moleses.

"Moleses is sut'n'y curious little creatures, "she continued. "I bin teckin' tickler notuss un'emdis long time, any day knows moon you would think far, heture look at them.
