It has also been validated by the explosion of the holy scripture, because it is written: "Thou shall not offer unto devils," The word for devils here is Seghuirim which has the meaning for rough and hairy goats. It further explains, that the devil usually appeared in that shape. Scholars like the rabbins, Tremellius and Dr Joseph Mede had explained that the devil couldnot be appear in the human shape as long as man keeps his integriy toward humanity. The only reason behind his appearance as a beast is the fact that he was a beautiful perfect creature, who volunterly degraded himself through rebellion to the state of imperfection. No other reason can be found, why he had appeared to Eve in the shape of a serpent instead of a human. This former view of the devil is no longer valid, because of the downfall of man, the devil can appear even as the angel of light.
