I perceive that this is the case
from two illustrations he was kind enough to forward me, being stereographs of a [T-square]
square, placed with the points of junction towards the observer, and the tail receding from
him; and in one case the angle of the square is made the centre of radiation, and while its
distance from the camera is only six feet, the points of delineation are no less than three
feet apart.

To push an argument to the extreme to test its value, is quite right; but this goes far beyond
the extreme, if I may be allowed such a very Hibernian expression.

No object, however minute, can be clearly seen if brought nearer to the eyes than a certain
point, because it will be what is technically called out of focus. It is true that this point
differs in different individuals, but the average distance of healthy vision is 10 inches.
Now, adopting MR. MERRITT'S own standard of 2Â½ inches between the eyes, it is clear that supposing
the central point had been rightly selected, the distance between the cameras was only double
what might have been taken an extreme distance. It is scarcely necessary to suggest what a
person devoid of taste (in which category I am no doubt included) might do in producing monstrosities
by adopting the radial method, as such an one is not very likely to produce good results at all.

I now address myself to another accusation. It is quite true that I am unacquainted with the
scholastic dogmas of perspective, but equally true that I am familiar with the facts thereof,
as any one must be who has studied optical and geometrical science generally; and while I concur
in the propositions as enunciated for a one-eyed picture, I by no means agree to the assumption
that the "vanishing points," in the two stereographs taken radially with the necessary precautions,
"would be so far apart, that they could not in the stereoscope flow into one;" on the contrary,
direct experiment shows me, what reason also suggests, that they do flow into one as completely
as in nature when viewed by both eyes.
