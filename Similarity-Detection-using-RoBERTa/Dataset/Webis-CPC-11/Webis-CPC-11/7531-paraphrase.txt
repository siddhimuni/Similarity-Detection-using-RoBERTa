The pupil, breaking the rules of the school, went on one of his first flights which was beyond the limits of the aerodrome and indeed disappeared from the view of those near the sheds. Near aerodrome was a main road with had tramway-lines along it.
A tram happened to be passing down the road, with passengers on top of it. To the great astonishment of these passengers, they saw an aeroplane in full flight which was moving very low across a neighbouring field. It was approaching, declining towards them. The plane passed unpleasantly close above them, and then disappeared out of sight as dramatically as it had appeared. Its pilot was the student who had disobeyed his orders, and now he was on an erratic flight. After wanderings from the surrounding country, he started making his way back down towards the aerodrome and still flying unreasonably low.

There were some trees on the border of one end of the aerodrome; as though he thought to finish this achievement of his by charging into them, he was steering nearer to them. As he came nearer, he still did not turn right or left. His instructor, and those gathered with him on the place, made their minds up that an accident was inevitable now. But luckily for him, there was a space between the trees, which was only large enough for an aeroplane to pass through it. A skilled pilot would not have risked his plane in an attempt to pass between those trees.

But this student, unexperienced as he was, steered towards the gap and passed through it so precisely that it would have made an accomplished pilot envious. Finally he landed the plane on the aerodrome and climbed out of it--"not having turned a hair," as the saying goes.

The instructor's remarks when he came near the plane, are not to be found on the record, this is as well, no doubt.
