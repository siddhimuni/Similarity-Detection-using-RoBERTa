The gunner laid the long arm of the quadrant in the bore of the gun, and the line of the
bob against the graduated quarter-circle showed the gun's angle of elevation.

The addition of the quadrant to the art of artillery opened a whole new field for the mathematicians,
who set about compiling long, complicated, and jealously guarded tables for the gunner's guidance.
But the theory was simple: since a cannon at 45° elevation would fire ten times farther than
it would when the barrel was level (at zero° elevation), the quadrant should be marked into
ten equal parts; the range of the gun would therefore increase by one-tenth each time the gun
was elevated to the next mark on the quadrant. In other words, the gunner could get the range
he wanted simply by raising his piece to the proper mark on the instrument.

Collado explained how it worked in the 1590's. "We experimented with a culverin that fired
a 20-pound iron ball. At point-blank the first shot ranged 200 paces. At 45-degree elevation
it shot ten times farther, or 2,000 paces.... If the point-blank range is 200 paces, then elevating
to the first position, or a tenth part of the quadrant, will gain 180 paces more, and advancing
another point will gain so much again. It is the same with the other points up to the elevation
of 45 degrees; each one gains the same 180 paces." Collado admitted that results were not always
consistent with theory, but it was many years before the physicists understood the effect of
air resistance on the trajectory of the projectile.
