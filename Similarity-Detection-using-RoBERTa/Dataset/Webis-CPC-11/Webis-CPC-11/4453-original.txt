The Athenians, and also the Romans, kept
this exercise in great honour in their academies; the Italians retain some traces of it to
this day, to their great advantage, as is manifest by the comparison of our understandings
with theirs.  If I converse with a strong mind and a rough disputant, he presses upon my flanks,
and pricks me right and left; his imaginations stir up mine; jealousy, glory, and contention,
stimulate and raise me up to something above myself; and acquiescence is a quality altogether
tedious in discourse.  But, as our mind fortifies itself by the communication of vigorous and
regular understandings, 'tis not to be expressed how much it loses and degenerates by the continual
commerce and familiarity we have with mean and weak spirits; there is no contagion that spreads
like that; I know sufficiently by experience what 'tis worth a yard.  I love to discourse and
dispute, but it is with but few men, and for myself; for to do it as a spectacle and entertainment
to great persons, and to make of a man's wit and words competitive parade is, in my opinion,
very unbecoming a man of honour.

Folly is a bad quality; but not to be able to endure it, to fret and vex at it, as I do, is
another sort of disease little less troublesome than folly itself; and is the thing that I
will now accuse in myself.  I enter into conference, and dispute with great liberty and facility,
forasmuch as opinion meets in me with a soil very unfit for penetration, and wherein to take
any deep root; no propositions astonish me, no belief offends me, though never so contrary
to my own; there is no so frivolous and extravagant fancy that does not seem to me suitable
to the production of human wit.  We, who deprive our judgment of the right of determining,
look indifferently upon the diverse opinions, and if we incline not our judgment to them, yet
we easily give them the hearing: Where one scale is totally empty, I let the other waver under
an old wife's dreams; and I think myself excusable, if I prefer the odd number; Thursday rather
than Friday; if I had rather be the twelfth or fourteenth than the thirteenth at table; if
I had rather, on a journey, see a hare run by me than cross my way, and rather give my man
my left foot than my right, when he comes to put on my stockings.

The contradictions of judgments, then, neither offend nor alter, they only rouse and exercise,
me. We evade correction, whereas we ought to offer and present ourselves to it, especially
when it appears in the form of conference, and not of authority.
