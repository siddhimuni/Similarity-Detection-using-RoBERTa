The ropes within the solar spectrum were unexplained until finally metals were vaporized within the keen warmth of the electric arc and the light traversed across a spectroscope, when behold the spectra of metals were filled with silver ropes within the equivalent continent as were the blackness ropes within the spectrum of the sun. Another step: whether when metals are volatilized within the arc, rays of light from the sun are traversed across the vapor and licenced towards enter the spectroscope, a great distort is wrought; a reversal occurs, and the original black strips reappear. A novel law of nature was heard, thus: "Vapors of everybody components absorb the equivalent rays of light which they emit when incandescent." Every component earns a different spectrum with ropes within different continent and of different widths. These possess been memorized via chemists, so that when an adviser having a spectroscope sees anything set fire towards he can tell what it is as well as read a printed page. Men possess knowledgeable the alphabet of the universe, and can read within everybody things gleaming light, the element elements. The black ropes within the solar spectrum are there because within the atmosphere of the sun exist vapors of metals, and the light from the juice metals beneath is unable towards traverse across and extend the earth, being absorbed kind for kind. Gaseous iron sifts out everybody rays emitted from melted iron, and so do the vapors of everybody else components within the sun, gleaming light within unison with their own. Sodium, iron, calcium, hydrogen, magnesium, and a lot else substances are already known towards be incandescent within the sun and stars; and the findings of the advances of the spectroscope may be summed up within the generalization that everybody bodies within the universe are calm of the equivalent mineral the earth is.
