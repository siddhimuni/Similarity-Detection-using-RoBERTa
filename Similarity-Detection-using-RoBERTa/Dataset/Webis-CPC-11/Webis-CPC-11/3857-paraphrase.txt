It may not be that simple a question.  We are, therefore, able to sort the kinds of line within this print with the help of these obvious differences. 

The author has made an attempt to recreate the state of the plate after Rembrandt’s etching and before the application of drypoint(figure 12), by tracing only the etched lines in the print.
Rembrandt’s etched lines form only a foundation or skeleton for the finished work is obvious and it is not complete in itself. The important difference here being the lack of all the rich contrasts of light and shade found in Rembrandt’s finished work.

It is a general opinion that Rembrandt followed a fairy normal process of stopping-out and also re-etching while making his prints.  It is evident that this procedure was not followed here.  Stopping-out is a process whereby the variations in the depth of etched lines are created.  The plate may be removed from the acid after etched for a period of time and a stop-out varnish, similar in texture and acid resistant may be used to cover some of its lines. The remaining lines are etched more deeply, by immersing the plate in the acid. A wide range of intensity can be brought about by repeating this process. The change in depth of acid corroding is readily visible, where stop-out varnish is applied.
