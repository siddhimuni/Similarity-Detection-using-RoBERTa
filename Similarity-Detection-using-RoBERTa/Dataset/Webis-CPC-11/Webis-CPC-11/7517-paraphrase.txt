I have been irregular in diary writing.The individualised minutes had been made :On april 3, 1834 My diary had been missing.Ihad been so much disturbed since then that I could not rewrite. I forgot the dates and days. At the stepney's ,last night,I met the Milmans,Mrs Norton,Rogers,Sydney Smith and others.There was poor Jane porter among them.Oh! I met Lord jeffrey, and we had a brisk moment together.

  Of the same party she writes again:I found Miss Jane Porter poorly dressed like a saint, Mrs Somerville in a rocket shaped cap.I entered in an elegant way,dressed in the blue satin and point lace, ready to make them aware how a female writer should be dressed.

   She had a fairly huge illusion. Her whim was so high that she thought the reforms in legislation for ireland was influenced by her novel of Florence Macarthy.She made herself laughable,by boasting that she taught Taglioni the irish jig, of her toilette,which was made by her own hand.

    An elegant way of description of the contributors to the journal as depicted in the Fraserians, Lady Morgan is pictured trying on a big ,showy bonnet in front of a mirror,with a comical way of satisfaction and anxiety on her face.

     In the opinion of Chorley,the feared and fearless critic,Lady Morgan as one of the most eccentric person he had ever met.He adds,after long pause,"May I speak freely,she never changed in her manners or had been desperate .She had been throughout a woman of genius,never once appealed or apologised."
    The Lady seemed not at all pleased with the description made by an American paper ,the Boston Litrary Gazette.It had took a great effort to describe her as "shortwith a broad face blue inexpressive eyes about forty years of age". She reacted and exclaimed in a critical way and said "I appeal to the titian of his age--I appeal to you, Sir Thomas Lawrence.
