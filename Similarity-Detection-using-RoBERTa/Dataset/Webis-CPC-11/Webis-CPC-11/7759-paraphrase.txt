Hemorrhage from the mucous membrane of the stomach after abdominal surgery--also possibly resulting from toxins rather than from the surgery--causes what is known as post-operative haematemesis.

Constitutional Effects of Hemorrhage.
The intensity of the symptoms that are caused by the hemorrhage depends both on the rate of the bleeding that occurs and on the volume of blood that is lost. If a large amount of blood is lost, either from an open wound or into a serous cavity--after an injury to the liver or spleen, for example--results in significant pallor of the patient and a drop in the skin temperature, particularly on the face and the extremities. The skin becomes moist and will feel cold and clammy. Beads of sweat will be noticed on the forehead. The patient will have a rapid and feeble pulse, will feel fatigued, listless, and very thirsty. Other symptoms include low temperature and fast, shallow, and labored breathing. The patient will experience unusual visual phenomena such as light flashes or spots in the field of vision, and unusual sounds such as a buzzing, rushing, or ringing.

In particularly severe cases, the patient may experience a set of symptoms that are characterized as "air hunger." Because of the insufficient amount of blood in the circulatory system, and the reduced content of hemoglobin in the blood, the patient's tissues are not sufficiently oxygenated. This will cause the patient to experience significant restlessness. He will gasp for air, flail his arms, and clutch at his chest in the desperate attempt to draw a full breath.
