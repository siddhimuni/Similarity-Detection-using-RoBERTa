A popular British writer of our time, to demonstrate the law of compensation, in terms of the literary vocation, citing its low cost - arguing that while the artist has to invest their capital, however small, in colors, marble, material, and the study of rent, and professional men occupy an expensive place, but the author needs a hand sheet and a pen and ink to create trade. 
While it is not the literal truth in this comparison, the fact is not applicable to historical writing, except in a very limited extent. The preparation of the most successful works in this department, in modern times, has been served with a payment impossible for the poor student. It has involved the review and reproduction of large manuscript authorities, distant travel, purchase of books and papers of the family, and sometimes occupied reference years, observation and study, only the prospect of profit. The same amount of culture and the strength of the composition easier for less affluent authors spend a masterful review would be enough to make them famous historians, if blessed with the moral means to seek external sources of information, or meet them dispersed materials little with which to weave a chronicle of the past. 

Therefore, not only has become the chosen field of history by writers with no special gift for individual classes inspired by the literature but educated children of fortune. It is therefore interesting to note the contrast between the lives of historians and poets, and on the average of the first there is some justification for the title of an aristocratic clan lyrics. Compare humble house of Cowper in Olney with the collection of elegant Gibbon in Lausanne - the social environment of Hallam, Grote, Macaulay with insulation or rustic Wordsworth, Shelley economies, or life-struggle Jerrold.
