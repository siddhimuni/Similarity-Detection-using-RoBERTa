When, however, Charlotte returned to Brussels alone was warmly received in two or three English families, including those of Mr. Dixon, the Rev. Mr. Jenkins, and Dr. Wheelwright. With children sometimes Wheelwright spent Sunday, and they occasionally visited the English Episcopal Church Wheelwrights attended, and the cleric was a Mr Drury. When Dr. Wheelwright took his wife for a trip to Rhine in May that left her four children - one girl had died in Brussels, seven years in late November - in the care of Madame Heger in the pensioner, and under the immediate supervision of Charlotte. 
In this period there was a lot of joy in your life. She was learning German. Was teaching English to M. Heger, her brother-in-law, Mr. Chappelle. He went to the Carnival, and described "the animation to see the huge crowds and general merriment. "Every time I go back, 'she writes," to compare what I am with what I was, my place here at my house to Mrs Sidgwick or Mrs. White, I am grateful. " 

In a letter to his brother, however, we find the darker side of the image. It reveals many things other than what is actually written down. In this, the only card that Branwell as I can discover, and a written in childhood, it seems that the brother and sister are available only under very confidential. Until then, in any case, the conduct Branwell had not awakened any fear for their future, and the absence of any important place in the will of his aunt, was clearly not due to misconduct. Branwell was now under the same roof as her sister Anna, having obtained an appointment as guardian of young Edmund Robinson at Thorp Green, near York, where Anne was governess. The letter is signed, ending playfully with 'yours, and the initials follow a closing message to Anne on the same sheet of paper.
