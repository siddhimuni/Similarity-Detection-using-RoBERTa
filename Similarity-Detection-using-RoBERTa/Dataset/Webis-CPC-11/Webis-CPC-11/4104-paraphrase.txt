Custom has limited the use of abridged titles to classes, collective bodies in which the adjective takes the same form as the noun would.  It would be just as well to say "a heavy" as "the heavies" and they all become unintelligble when we lose the noun to which they belong.  If A.E.B. would assert that a glass of "cold without," it was understood by the people at the time to mean "brandy and cold water"  was really language from the "well of pureset English".  The confusion of ideas were complete.

I doubt whethere the word "News" reflects the idea of "new" at all.  Is there anything new? and is there news? In my mind are totally different ideas.  To the English speaking mind it is not necesarily "new" or "news".  In an old dictionary from 1573 There is "Olde news or stale newes".  The A.E.B has "news" as plural and cites the cardinal of New York.  I believe this to be wrong, as does the A.E.B. when his object was not to confound me, as may be his practice, his concluding paragraph "The newes WAS of the victory,".  The word "means" on the other hand is plural.  What does shakepsear say on the subject?

"Yet nature is made letter by no mean But nature makes the mean"

The plural is formed byt he addition of "S" but very rarely the use of the word except in the plurar, the singular form is obsolete.  In this case the same form applies for singular and plural.  If you apply this reasoning to "News" you must forget thatt there is a word "new" to start with.

I fell I am not bound to give proof of such an obvious fact, that most of the most similarities in langage are just coincidence.  Words come from the same root, and retain that meaning.  Even the most distant roots frequetnly meet in the same place.  When you letters, therefore, tell me the French word "noise" rewound containst not one element of our English words.
