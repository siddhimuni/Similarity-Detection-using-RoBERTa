[Returns to his seat.

Usher (calls). Admiral Cuttermaran!

Admiral (quietly). Here!

[Exit the prisoner, first handed him the salts, and enters the witness stand.

Council for the Prosecution (after the witness has been sworn). I think you're here in the summons served by the Treasury.

Witness (with a look of sadness in the Dock). If it had not been called to be present for those in authority, not the prayers of the Magi who brought me here!

Coun. for professionals. "I can consider them a witness does not want?

Witness (with difficulty acute emotion delete). At most, a majority of the witnesses is very favorable!

Coun. for Def. (With contempt). Not wanting!

Coun. for professionals. (In a tone of protest.) Actually I have to beg my learned friend to refrain from disrupting the process. These constant interruptions are most bothersome.

Coun. for Def. (Roughness). As your Lordship wants. Grants [.

Coun. to professionals. But despite being a witness does not want, no doubt the prisoner was forging his name?

Witness (sadly). Yes, I'm not.

Coun. to Def. Still you are here, and pushing is that poor kid to prison doors! (Prisoner snivels.) Yes, you are trying (one of your own flesh and blood) a never-to-be-recalled injury!

Witness (animated). Only my duty, sir. I obey only my duty!

Coun. to Def. Your duty! Why, man, how can it be your duty?

Coun. to Def. But, my Lord, the task is difficult.

Mr. Punch Justice. If it is beyond its powers, certainly some of his colleagues willingly come to its aid.

Coun. to Def. No, my Lord, I do not mean what your lordship means. I am very capable of performing the functions it has been a pleasure and pride to accept.

Judge Punch (fatigue). Pray we have to move forward?

Coun. to Def. Do not you think that something very cruel, and disgusting that a man should be held against their immediate family?
