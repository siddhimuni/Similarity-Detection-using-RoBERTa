A still more perfect contrivance of the same kind has been exhibited for some time in London
and Paris under the title of Cosmorama (from Greek words signifying views of the world, because
of the great variety of views.) Pictures of moderate size are placed beyond what have the appearance
of common windows, but of which the panes are really large convex lenses fitted to correct
the errors of appearance which the nearness of the pictures would else produce. Then by farther
using various subordinate contrivances, calculated to aid and heighten the effects, even shrewd
judges have been led to suppose the small pictures behind the glasses to be very large pictures,
while all others have let their eyes dwell upon them with admiration, as magical realizations
of the natural scenes and objects. Because this contrivance is cheap and simple, many persons
affect to despise it; but they do not thereby show their wisdom; for to have made so perfect
a representation of objects, is one of the most sublime triumphs of art, whether we regard
the pictures drawn in such true perspective and colouring, or the lenses which assist the eye
in examining them.

"It has already been stated, that the effect of such glasses in looking at near pictures, is
obtainable in a considerable degree without a glass, by making the pictures very large and
placing them at a corresponding distance. The rule of proportion in such a case is, that a
picture of one foot square at one foot distance from the eye, appears as large as a picture
of sixty feet square at sixty feet distance. The exhibition called the Diorama is merely a
large painting prepared in accordance with the principle now explained. In principle it has
no advantage over the cosmorama or the show box, to compensate for the great expense incurred,
but that many persons may stand before it at a time, all very near the true point of sight,
and deriving the pleasure of sympathy in their admiration of it, while no slight motion of
the spectator can make the eye lose its point of view."
