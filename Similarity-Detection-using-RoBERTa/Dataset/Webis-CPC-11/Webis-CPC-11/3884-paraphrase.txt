God knows, I have my best to succeed at work, but like all other positions we held. Somehow or other I seem to be able to provide satisfaction. While I'm on my guard, and as alert as I know how to be against one of the things I was not told to do, I'm just as sure as the sun to go and do some things, others that it is against the rules. If you do something against the rules, then I forgot to do something I was told to do. If I remember to do something I was told to do, then I am quite likely to make a mistake strange that nobody ever thought of framing a rule to match. The result is that in almost every other week or at most two, will be out of jobs again. I tried driving a delivery wagon. I tried food stores. I tried doing collections. I started once as a bank official. Immediately after leaving college, I started as a newspaper reporter. I was a newsboy on the railroad trains. I sold candy and nuts in a fair ground. I was in a hotel night clerk. I was a steward Steamboat. I was a shipping clerk at a publishing house, and I was fired from every job I ever had. True enough, I hated them all, but nevertheless, I tried to do my best in them. Why can not succeed with any of them do not know, yet I have a feeling that somehow, somewhere, sometime, I will find something to do that I'll love and can do well. "

"Music", I said, "undoubtedly the music."

"Do you think I could?" He said thoughtfully. "Music was my passion all my life long been my joy, my consolation in all my wanderings and all my failures .. But I was always afraid I would fail also, in that, and if I , it would break my heart for sure, but if you think you have talent., then I give all my time, my whole thought, my energy, all the music continue.
