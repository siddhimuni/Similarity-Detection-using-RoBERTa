THE MAN WHO WENT

*****

Mr. HENLEY asks off-hand in the Song of the Sword and Other Verses, "What have I done for you, England, my England?" If I must answer, I say Mr. HENLEY has done nothing but parody England, though there are few who will read it. Mr. HENLEY's versification is pretty, but it is spoiled by a tiring habit of smartness, and his self-regard occasionally becomes ludicrous. 'ARRY would have turned out this sort of stuff if he had been at the University to study verse-making. 'ARRY seems a far cry from HENLEY, but the levelheaded observer will see essential similarities in these brimstone-smelling pages. They share that narrowness of view, that certainty that each alone is right, which distinguish 'ARRY's reflections when he surveys society from his lower position.

A Book of Wise Sayings, by W.A. CLOUSTON, has been published by Messrs. HUTCHINSON & Co. W.A. CLOUSTON selected them, of course, not said them himself. I find one fault: only the name of each author is affixed to each wise saying, not the chapter and verse. Thus it is impossible for the average reader to know when or where the saying was made. But here is a satisying example for now:

"Safe in thy breast close lock up thy intents, For he that knows thy purpose best prevents."--Randolph

Isn't that charming? Isn't it "RANDOLPH" himself? Can anyone guess what course our RANDOLPH's life will take?

"R. CHAMBERLAIN" has been quoted as well--not JOSEPH--but I am not as familiar with his works as I could be.
