In
most cases, however, the nervous invalid is suffering not from lack of opportunities for outside
interest but from an inner inability to meet the opportunities which present themselves. The
great change that has to be made is not in external conditions and habits but in the hidden
corners of the mind; a change that can be accomplished only by self-knowledge and re-education.

But if self-knowledge is the first step in any cure, so self-giving must be the final step.
Sooner or later in the life of every nervous invalid there comes a time when nothing will serve
to unify his disorganized forces but steady and unswerving responsibility for a good stiff
piece of work. Happy for him that this is so and that he is living in a day when science no
longer tells him to fold his hands and wait.
