He shows a truly remarkable sight when it comes to the conclusion that it 
It is very likely that parts of the uterus and sperm wattles are naturally suited to the separation of airborne particles in the arterial blood. 

These observations are based, therefore, that the blood of the embryo carried by the umbilical arteries to the placenta or the uterine caruncle transport to the fetus, not only nutritious juice, but also a portion of the nitro-aerial particles, so that blood from the baby seems to be imbued with nitro-aerial particles by circulation through the umbilical vessels in the same way as in the pulmonary vessels. 

Therefore, I believe the placenta and should not be called a liver cancer, but rather a lung of the uterus [34]. 

Although the analysis of attempted Mayow of respiration of the chick embryo in ovo is less successful, his views on the respiration of the fetus were quickly accepted by many, and its area is presented as a major contribution to the physiological embryology. 

Studies of people like John Standard reporting the weight of various parts of the hen's egg, for example, shell, yolk, white, reveal the embryological research wing that is increasingly obsessed with quantification and physical-chemical analysis of the embryo and its vital functions. 

There was, however, immediately set to become the mainstream of embryological research. For as Mayow studies were ongoing, embryology embarked on a course that leads to preformationism. In the late seventeenth century, the idea that the embryo was enclosed in miniature, either egg or sperm cells rose to a position of doctrine, and after that there was little support for the quantitative study of development.
