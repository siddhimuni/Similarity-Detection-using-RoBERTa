There is a deep contrast noticed by a traveller to the Milanese where peasants have black hair and eyes, their italian features almost oriental-seeming. Higher in the Biscayan country the people are of a fair complexion unlike that of Castilians. Atlantica Berbers have brown skin and black hair while Shuluh mountain folk are lighter, the higher inhabitants, from Mt Aurasius have ginger hair and blue eyes, and are thought by some to be of Vandal origin.

This pattern of variation is also to be observed further south in Africa, where local conditions determine the physical features of inhabitants, lightening in cooler environments, recapitulated throughout the continent.

The most stereotypically "Negro" in appearance tend to live in swampy near-coastal regions, sometimes eking out a scarce existence dependent on the sea.

The inhabitants of the mountains of Ethiopia, Mandingos for example while still african, do not appear to European eyes to have as much of the features considered ugly by early visitors.

Carthage, near modern Tunis, was founded by Elissa, also known as Dido, in 846 BC. King Ethbaal was her great grandfather. Pygmalion, her brother, killed her husband for his treasures which she took with her to found Carthage
