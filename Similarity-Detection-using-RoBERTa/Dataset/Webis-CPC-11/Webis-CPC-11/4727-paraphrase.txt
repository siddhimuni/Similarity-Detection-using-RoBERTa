Native travelers from Nkulu claim that beyond the tiny upper fall where the projections shut out al view, the channel smoothens for a small moment and carries the canoes through it.  Most take the mouantin path which cuts across and easterly bend to Banza Menzi which is situated on a level platform located 9 miles north of Nkulu.  There they find a violent stream.
Banza Ninga is the final destination of the second march.  Inga, which is the first expedition, leads travelers down an indirent line of 15 miles which takes most 5 hours to travel.
The third is about the same distance and makes Banza Mavunda, where approximately 20-24 miles above the Yellala Tuckey found the river manageable.  The center of the river was clear and flowing at a rate of 2 miles per hour.  This effect has been remarked in the Brazilian "Cachoeiras."  Above this the Nzadi widens allowing canoeing with portages at the two Sangallas.  In the south it doubles like the Yellala showing an upper and lower break which is separated by 2 miles.  The rapids begin forming here since there are many sunken ledges of rock.  Two days of paddling to the nort leads to the highest Sangalla, which obstructs the stream for 22 miles.  Tuckey's Songa Sangalla contains three rapids; Professor Smith's contains 6 rapids, however, his topography is very vague.  Nsundi, which was reached on Septemeber 9th, is a picturesque sandy cove located at the opening of the creek.  This begins the lake-like river which is three miles in width.
It is here that the Nzadi is bound by low limestone hills which show the basin of Central Africa.  Here, the land is well populated since the districts are fertile and provisions are plentiful.  Professor Smith was incredibly impressed with the improved appearance of the country that it was very difficult for him to leave.  
Traveling along the winding river bed from the Vivi Rapids to Nsundi is an approximate distance of  115 miles; the direct land march is only 75 miles.
