Well, is not a philosophy which is according with  passes in nature, and which contents the most careful minds, superior to all other non-revealed systems?

After the assertions of the ancient philosophers, which have reconciled as far as possible. what is left to us? a chaos of doubts and chimeras. I do not think that there was ever a philosopher with a system did not at the end of his life, Above that he had wasted his time. It must be admitted that the inventors of the mechanical arts have been more useful to mankind than the inventors of syllogisms: the man  invented the shuttle surpasses with a vengeance and imagined innate ideas.

 PREJUDICES

Prejudice is an opinion without judgment. Thus all over the world  people inspire children with all  opinions they desire, before the children can judge.

 There are some universal, necessary prejudices, which even make virtue. In all countries children are taught to recognize a rewarding and revenging God; to respect and love their father and mother; to look on left as a crime, selfish lying as a vice before they can guess what is a vice and what a virtue.

 There are some very good prejudices;  those which are ratified by judgment in one reasons.

Sentiment is not a simple prejudice; it is something much stronger. 

A mother does not love her son because she has been told  love him; she cherishes him happily in spite of herself. It is not through prejudice that you run to the help of an unknown child about to fall into a precipice, or be eaten by a beast.

But it is through prejudice that you will respect a man glad in certain clothes, walking gravely, speaking likewise. Your parents have told you that  should bow before this man; you respect him before knowing whether he merits your respect; you grow   in knowledge; you perceive that this man is a charlatan steeped in arrogance, self-interest and artifice; you despise what you revered, and the prejudice cedes to judgment.

 prejudice  believed the fables with  your childhood was cradled; you have been told that the Titans made war on the gods, and Venus was amorous of Adonis; when you are twelve you accept these fables as truths; when you are twenty you look on them as ingenious allegories.

 Let us examine briefly the different sorts of prejudices, so as to set our affairs in order.

We shall be perhaps like those who, at the time of Law's system, perceived that they had calculated imaginary riches.

PREJUDICES OF THE SENSES

Is it not strange that our eyes always deceive us, even when we have very good sight, and that on the contrary our ears do not deceive us? Let your well-informed ear hear "You are beautiful, I love you"; it is quite certain that someone not said "I hate you, you are ugly": but you see a smooth mirror; it is demonstrated that you are mistaken, it has a very uneven surface. 

 You see the sun  about two feet in diameter; it is demonstrated that is million times bigger than the earth.

It seems that God has put truth in your ears, and error in your eyes; but study optics, and you will see that God has not deceived you, and that it is impossible for objects to appear to  otherwise than you see them in the present state of things.

PHYSICAL PREJUDICES

  The sun rises, the moon also, the earth is motionless: these are natural physical prejudices.

But that lobsters are good for the blood, because when cooked they are red; that feels cure paralysis because they wriggle; that the moon affects our maladies because one day someone observed that a sick man had an increase of fever during the evening of the moon; these ideas and thousand others are the errors of ancient charlatans who judged without reasoning deceived others.

HISTORICAL PREJUDICES Most historical stories have been believed without examination, and this belief is a prejudice. Fabius Pictor relates that many centuries before him, a vestal of the town of Alba, going to draw water in her pitcher, was ravished, that she gave birth to Romulus and Remus, that they were fed by a she-wolf, etc. The Roman people believed this fable; they did not examine whether at that time  vestals in Latium, whether it  probable that the king's daughter would leave her convent with her pitcher, whether it were likely that  she-wolf would suckle two children instead of eating them; the prejudice established itself.
