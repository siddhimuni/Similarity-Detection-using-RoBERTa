King William supplied copious materials for either verse
or prose.  He was really in Prior's mind what he represents him in his verses; he considered
him as a hero, and was accustomed to say that he praised others in compliance with the fashion,
but that in celebrating King William he followed his inclination.  To Prior, gratitude would
dictate praise, which reason would not refuse.

Among the advantages to arise from the future years of William's reign, he mentions a Society
for Useful Arts, and among them:-

"Some that with care true eloquence shall teach,
And to just idioms fix our doubtful speech;
That from our writers distant realms may know
   The thanks we to our monarchs owe,
And schools profess our tongue through every land
That has invoked his aid, or blessed his hand."

Tickell, in his "Prospect of Peace," has the same hope of a new academy:-

"In happy chains our daring language bound, Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound."

Whether the similitude of those passages, which exhibit the same thought on the same occasion,
proceeded from accident or imitation, is not easy to determine.  Tickell might have been impressed
with his expectation by Swift's "Proposal for Ascertaining the English Language," then lately
published.

In the Parliament that met in 1701 he was chosen representative of East Grinstead.  Perhaps
it was about this time that he changed his party, for he voted for the impeachment of those
lords who had persuaded the king to the Partition Treaty, a treaty in which he himself had
been ministerially employed.
