The first tract to be issed on the First Sudnay of November.

The triumph that was attended Messrs Chamber's trials in the preparring a cheap and nurturing type of literature, made them announce a new literary peridical, with the title of Repository of Instructive and Amusing Tracts.  This work, was to resemble in some fashion, the Miscellany of tracts which had been completed a few years earlier, but aiming at a higher tone.  It was hoped it would satisfy the new requirements of literary elegance.  With respect to Messrs Chambers will to assist the skilled writer in different areas; and as a whole of the workds be under their own editorial direction, they can with approval offfer the repository as a companion to the family circle.  Each tract will embrace a single diea, set to suite different tastes. An important object will be to provide gentle entertainment with good teaching; and as far as possible to provide it for free.  The editors are therefore trust that the tracts will take a significant part in the educating the people which are commited to the agency of the press.

The repository will have a serise of penny sheets issued weekly, four every month.  Fivepence per month and eight for a two month volume.  It should be well done in a fancy board for one shilling.  Where it is desirable, wood engravings will be introduced.  Every Volume will have an engraved Title page.
