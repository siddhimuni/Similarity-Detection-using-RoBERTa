They themselves, however had lost nothing, and gained a great deal by the efforts they had made to cultivate greater openness to others, both in their marriages and in their marriages and in their winder   relationships, and they would lovingly invite other Frineds to make the same venture. They would also  plead with Friends to give stronger support to, and undertake more active participation in a project to provide marriage enrichment retreats for the couples in the care of our Meetings.

Some views were expressed suggesting a special reticence among Friends. There seemed to be some foundation for two theories-first, that Quakers tend to be very heavily involved in social projects, sometimes to the neglect of their own family relationship; and second, that they tend to be somewhat puritancial in the sense that they consider it improper to open their private lives to others. There may be a deep dichotomy in attitudes of Friends here such as reported by one couple: "vivid impressions of honest encounters between those who regard the worship of God as a private affair, and those who feel the need to reach out to their Meeting community for personal support and a sense of communion which includes closer relationships with other Friends."

Like other Friends, we are finding that these experiences can release hitherto unrealized and untapped resources of spiritual strength and power. As expressed by one couple: "For two years we passed through a dark time in our Family, trying to find resources to deal with a seemingly insurmountable problem. At our first retreat, with the loving support of the group, we were able as a couple to recover our self-confidence, sense of worth, and well-being, and reaffirm our strengths to each other. 

The family problem has now been happily resolved, and we have found extra strength to participate fully in the expression of our Quaker concerns in the larger community.
