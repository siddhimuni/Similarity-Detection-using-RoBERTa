So, that's all? It works well with "free thought" and "free speech." There's an evolutionist is all bent-out-of-shape about preachers knowing nothing of science, while one says not to worry so much about science, and the other, still, says the theory riddled with holes; there's no way to prove evolution. 

What harmony there is just here? We theologians would say that natural selection should be present with instructors to advise or, at least, reject the worst the school has to give. This way we know our duty (natural selection). So much for broad principles. According to Haeckel, "Monistic materialism" is a branch of moneron, which is of one substance and semi-albuminous fluid. It would be interesting to know how all of the different substance and how they came to be. There are many questions about evolution, yet theologians aren't allowed to be heard? Rubbish. Besides, Mr. Haeckel doesn't question enough, and aren't all axioms of this order? Nevertheless, we can't help but say something. We believe in free thought and speech. Either way, it must be known that there was a time when all life began to exist on the planet. But where did they come from and how? The "high-priest" of Germany, who claims to be entitled, says that "spontaneous generation" was how all of this came to be. He said that, "Only organisms that are not yet differentiated and are similar to inorganic crystals in being homogeneously composed of one single substance, could arise by spontaneous generation, and could become the primeval parents of all other organisms." Such is Haeckel's germ of life.
