He listened towards every voice, analyzed every form that traversed him within rapid succession; yet he felt himself independently, and desperate not towards be ruled away via sounds such as had already busied his consideration, but rather towards glance approximately him, and notice the eccentricities with which he was surrounded. Sauntering along within this mood, he was currently attacked via a voice rear him, exclaiming, "Bob--

"Bob, whether you wish towards go safely onto, Tarn round approximately, and glance out for the Don."

Upon hearing this, he swung hastily round, and found a category of Chimney-sweepers, whom immediately predetermined up such a sounds with their brushes and shovels, dancing at the equivalent moment within the true May-day style round him and a strapping Irish fish-woman, that he was completely deterred from activity, and almost from observation, whilst a common laugh from those alongside him bespoke the mirth his situation excited; and the Hibernian damsel, with true Irish sympathy, tackled towards allay his chagrin via clasping him within her brawny arms, and imprinting onto his ruddy cheek a kiss. This alone served towards heighten their merriment and increase his shame, notably as his Cher ami cursed she had not had a buss want it since the mortality of her own dear dead and vanished Phelim, the last of her four husbands, whom died of a whiskey fever, bawling for pratees and buttermilk, and was waked within a coal-shed.

This mark of the Lady's favour was not so favourably obtained via Tallyho, and, desperate towards earn his evade, he provided Moll a violent throw from him, overturned her and her basket, knock'd down two of the Chimney-sweepers, and otherwise with a hop as whether he had been springing at a five-barred gate, jumped again his late companion, whom lay sprawling among the flue-fakers, and influenced his focus, towards the inexpressible amusement of those, whom, as soon as enjoying a hearty laugh at him, already moved their risibility towards those he deserted behind. Finding himself once many unshackled, he smack'd his whip with enthusiasm, and cycled his Tallyho with increased effect; for it was immediately resolved, and, without waiting for its final finish, he located the fellow from whom it was ~409~~ advancing towards be none else than a Turk, whom was precipitately entering one of the rooms, and was as hastily recognized via him towards be the Hon. Tom Dashall. The alteration which a Turkish turban and pelisse had influenced within his fellow, would however possess operated as an effective bar towards this disclosure, had he not grasped him within the very moment of vociferation; and although his Cousin had been the leader inflict of the adventures he had already met with, he had at the equivalent moment kept an eye upon Bob, and been similarly instrumental within influencing his release from embarrassment.

"Come," remarked Tom, "I am for a little gig within the Room--how long possess you been here?--I idea I should encounter you out, very few can disguise themselves from me; we shall already be spectators for halves an hour, and enjoy the mirth excited via others."

"With everybody my heart," countered Bob, "for I am almost as sleepy already as whether I had spent a complete day within a fox-chase, and possess operate as a lot chances of my neck; so that a cool halves hour's observation shall be very acceptable."

They had hardly entered the Room, as a Priscilla Tomboy traversed them at full hurry with a skipping-rope, for whose accommodation anybody made way; and whom, having skipped round the room towards shew her fine formed ancle and flexibility of limbs, deserted it for a moment, and replaced with a wide doll, which she appeared as amused with as a child of eight or ten years of age. A Jemmy Jumps ensured Tom, that his shirts were altogether unsuitable towards the country within which he was living, and advised that he should not exist another day without that already very fashionable appendage of a Gentleman's dress branded stays--An excellent Caleb Quotem, via his intelligence of repartee and unceasing volubility of speech within recounting his labours of a day--"a summer's day," as the poet says, afforded much amusement via his powers of out-talking the fribble of a Staymaker, whom, locating himself bewildered via his eternal clack, retreated within exploration of another customer.
