I want to help you. But how can I do it. I am as poor as a church mouse and you are awfully rich.So how could a man like me help you. But remember the story of a mouse who rescued a lion from the net by gnawling a hole in the net. In this way a poor person like me some how can help you. And I realy want that to happen .
          The Murmur of the storm
        John Heron was a very good friend of Roger Sands. There was a very good relation between both of them.Roger Sand not only used his brain but even risked his reputation and life against the powerful enemies "California Oil Trust King" . Heron was very thankful for it.  John Heron invited Roger to visit him and his wife  when he left to Newyork.On reading the news of Roger's marriage  Heron telegraphed congratulations  but the friendly reply was unacknowledged. The wedding gift of  a gold tea service was not accompanied by a covering letter. This agitated Roger . The reason he could only find is Beverley's failure to enclose a note to Mrs.Heron . 
        Roger felt that there was a misunderstanding  between  he and John Heron.At last he came to know that Mr. and Mrs.John Heron were going to spend the summer in the east. Without consulting Beverley he invited them to visit them to their Newport hous as soon as it was ready.He had written the letter from his home with the Park Avenue address on the paper. To-day when he entered his study there was a letter from John Heron.
