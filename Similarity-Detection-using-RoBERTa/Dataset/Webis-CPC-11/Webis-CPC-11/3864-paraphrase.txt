I would still like to speak more about the many splendid trips made across the interior plains, mountains, and deserts before the construction of Pacific Railroad, with ordinary “Doughertys” drawn by four smart mules, accompanied by soldiers, one with carbine or loaded musket in hand seated alongside the driver, while two more, with loaded rifles swung in the loops made for them, were seated in the back; the baggage was very light, and it consisted of a bag of oats instead of grass, and for the mules to be fastened while camping. I have traveled in this mode with an outfit of two, three, or four, for eighteen hundred miles in one season, usually from post to post, covering about two hundred miles a week, with the same promptness as a steam-car covers five hundred miles a day; but those are a dream now, and, while recognizing the great national advantages of the more rapid transport, I regret the change. Here I record one instance which happened in 1866: We climbed the Rocky Mountains to the Sangre-de-Cristo Pass, while returning from Fort Garland, along a bumpy and sidling road eastwards.  Getting down I walked ahead for four miles and waited for my “Dougherty”. When I saw a wagon coming down the road, after nearly an hour, I could not recognize as my own till it drew closer. It was upset; the top curved in and was beyond repair.  So we turned away to a camp of cavalry near the Spanish Peaks. Major A--- and his accomplished wife received us with hospitality.  A large hospital-tent, were dozen beautiful greyhounds were roaming freely was occupied by them. We renewed our journey the next morning once the ambulance was repaired, escorted by the major and his wife on their fine saddle horses.
