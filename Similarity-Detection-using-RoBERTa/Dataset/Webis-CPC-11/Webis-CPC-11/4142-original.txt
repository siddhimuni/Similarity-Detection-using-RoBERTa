On the contrary,
we still think them the most easy and equal way of taxing a nation, and perhaps it is demonstrable
that if we had fallen into this method at the beginning of the war of raising the year's expense
within the year by excises, England had not been now indebted so many millions, but what was
advisable under such a necessity and danger is not to be pursued in times of peace, especially
in a country depending so much upon trade and manufactures.

Our study now ought to be how those debts may be speedily cleared off, for which these new
revenues are the funds, that trade may again move freely as it did heretofore, without such
a heavy clog; but this point we shall more amply handle when we come to speak of our payments
to the public.

Mr. King divides the whole body of the people into two principal classes, viz.:-

Increasing the wealth of the kingdom 2,675,520 heads. Decreasing the wealth of the kingdom
2,825,000 heads.

By which he means that the first class of the people from land, arts, and industry maintain
themselves, and add every year something to the nation's general stock, and besides this, out
of their superfluity, contribute every year so much to the maintenance of others.

That of the second class some partly maintain themselves by labour (as the heads of the cottage
families), but that the rest, as most of the wives and children of these, sick and impotent
people, idle beggars and vagrants, are nourished at the cost of others, and are a yearly burden
to the public, consuming annually so much as would be otherwise added to the nation's general
stock.

The bodies of men are, without doubt, the most valuable treasure of a country, and in their
sphere the ordinary people are as serviceable to the commonwealth as the rich if they are employed
in honest labour and useful arts, and such being more in number do more contribute to increase
the nation's wealth than the higher rank.

But a country may be populous and yet poor (as were the ancient Gauls and Scythians), so that
numbers, unless they are well employed, make the body politic big but unwieldy, strong but
unactive, as to any uses of good government.
