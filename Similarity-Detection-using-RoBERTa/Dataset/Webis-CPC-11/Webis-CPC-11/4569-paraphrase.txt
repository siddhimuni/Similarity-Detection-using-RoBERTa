There was never such a thing said before on earth. He rants and rages as if gone insane. He is the greatest of the giving forth of bombast. And yet, his plays have sections of great power, some very eloquent indeed, and some that although a rant and argument, are in the realm of being sublime. And even with the utterances of true passion right next to expressions as false as possible, there are times when the main characters speak words of love and drop their roles as heroes only.

We now see Dryden as a critic and not a writer of poetry. We have spoken of his plays full of heroism yet we must now speak of his connection to the writing of rhyming heroic verse. Shakespeare himself showed us that the best verse for dramatic presentation is blank verse. Yet here we have Dryden, insisting that good plays can be written in rhyming verse. His plays are downright bad, not just because of the rhyming verse but because they are ridiculous. Actually the rhyming verse itself is the best thing about them. How horrid could they have been if written in blank verse we have to wonder. Yes, his "All for Love" and "Don Sebastian" are actually in blank verse and maybe could even be rated as fine plays. These plays are logical, he tried to write like Shakespeare with success. Why then should we think that those plays are better than ones written in rhyme? Because, rhyming verse would have given his heroic plays a vastly better tone. The rhyming verse itself can help the viewer pass through awkward and ridiculous parts of the plays giving them a bit of beauty in the poetic sense. Rhyming verse could have made the unbearable bearable, the dull, brilliant and helped to keep the audience interested even in the dullest spots. We can't help but think that the audience craves the loveliness of the rhyming poetry that they are used to and consider a work of beauty.
