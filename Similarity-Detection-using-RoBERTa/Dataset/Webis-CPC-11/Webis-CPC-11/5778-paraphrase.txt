Henry I.'s Tomb (Vol. viii., p. 411.).--I like that the famous mooted question, as to the existence of a massive tomb over the carcass of King Henry I. Having read Abbey, may at once be set at rest by referring to Tanner's Notitia Monastica, edit. 1744, in the second column of p. 15.: where it is obvious that a tomb and an effigy of King Henry I had once existed; that they both had fallen into dilapidated pieces; and that, King Richards II time period, the Abbot of reading was needed to reconstruct both the tomb and the effigy of King Henry the founder, who was immersed within the space of a single year, as the meliorate which the charters were to be sustained.
