This article looks at Lincoln's life in New Salem made for this Magazine by J. McCan Davis. 
LINCOLN: EARLY EXPERIENCES IN ILLINOIS. 
At the age of twenty-one, in March, 1830, Abraham Lincoln moved from Indiana to Macon County, Illinois where he assisted his father in settling into the new county during his first spring. 
Once summer arrived, he worked in the neighborhood until March of the following year, as a hired farm helper.  After that, he decided to go to Sangamon town, near Springfield, to construct a flatboat. 
In April he set sail on the flatboat for New Orleans.  He arrived one month later. He stayed in New Orleans for a month before going back to Illinois shortly to visit his parents’ new home in Coles County. In July, he followed up on an employment offer from Denton Offutt, and moved to New Salem to take charge of a mill and store which Offutt owned. The new store’s stock room was still empty when Lincoln got to New Salem. 
Rather than do nothing, Lincoln decided to travel by flatboat down the Sangamon and Illinois rivers.  He travelled along with a family taking their belongings to settle in Texas, and piloted their boat to Beardstown. 
Once he arrived in Beardstown, he located the goods for Offutt’s New Salem store waiting for transportation. 
While walking back to New Salem, he encountered a team with a cart and oxen, who were expected to link-up with the goods. 
The teamsters didn’t have any credentials, because Offutt thought Lincoln would wait at Beardstown until the ox-team arrive.  Because they lacked credentials, the teamsters wanted an order for the goods from Lincoln.
One of the teamsters said that Lincoln misspelled a word when he wrote out a note by the side of the road that said: 
IN CHARGE OF DENTON OFFUTT'S STORE. 
What date Offutt’s store opened isn’t known exactly. Records show that on July 8, 1831, Offutt  paid five dollars and was granted a retail merchandise license for New Salem from the County Commissioners' Court of Sangamon County.  The fee was for having one thousand dollars of stock for the store. 
The store opened,  in a small log cabin on a hill which was practically across the river, when the teamsters returned with the goods. 
A man named Vaner owned the copy of Kirkham's Grammar which Lincoln studied. Biographers debate whether the book was borrowed or owned, but since Vaner never regained possession of the book, it seems that Lincoln somehow acquired ownership. Lincoln studied the book to the point he almost knew it by heart. 
"Sometimes," says Herndon, "he would stretch out at full length on the counter, his head propped up on a stack of calico prints, studying it; or he would steal away to the shade of some inviting tree, and there spend hours at a time in a determined effort to fix in his mind the arbitrary rule that 'adverbs qualify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.'" 
This copy of Kirkham’s Grammar is now a Rutledge family treasure after Lincold presented the book to Ann Rutledge. Ann’s brother Robert studied the book after his sister’s death.  Robert’s widow, living in Casselton, North Dakota now owns the book. 
Lincoln inscribed the title page of the book with the words, "Ann M. Rutledge is now learning grammar."
