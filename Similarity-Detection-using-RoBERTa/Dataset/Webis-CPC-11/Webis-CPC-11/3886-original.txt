Instead of thinking of its ultimate constituents as
solid specks floating in a void, we must realise that it is the apparent void itself which
is solid, and that the specks are but bubbles on it. That fact once grasped, all the rest remains
as before. The relative position of what we have hitherto called matter and force is still
for us the same as ever; it is only that, on closer examination, both of these conceptions
prove to be variants of force, the one ensouling combinations of the other, and the real "matter,"
koilon, is seen to be something which has hitherto been altogether outside our scheme of thought.

In view of this marvellous distribution of Himself in "space," the familiar concept of the
"sacrifice of the LOGOS" takes on a new depth and splendour; this is His "dying in matter,"
His "perpetual sacrifice," and it may be the very glory of the LOGOS that He can sacrifice
Himself to the uttermost by thus permeating and making Himself one with that portion of koilon
which He chooses as the field of His universe.

What koilon is, what its origin, whether it is itself changed by the Divine Breath which is
poured into it--does "Dark Space" thus become "Bright Space" at the beginning of a manifestation?--these
are questions to which we cannot at present even indicate answers. Perchance an intelligent
study of the great Scriptures of the world may yield replies.

[2] The drawings of the elements were done by two Theosophical artists, Herr Hecker and Mrs.
Kirby, whom we sincerely thank; the diagrams, showing the details of the construction of each
"element," we owe to the most painstaking labour of Mr. Jinarâjadâsa, without whose aid it
would have been impossible for us to have presented clearly and definitely the complicated
arrangements by which the chemical elements are built up.
