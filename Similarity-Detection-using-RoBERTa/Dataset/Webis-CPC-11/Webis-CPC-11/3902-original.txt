By this means a gradually increasing or decreasing current is at each instant indicated at
its due strength. Thus, when this galvanometer is placed as the receiving-instrument at the
end of a long submarine cable, the movement of the spot of light, consequent on the completion
of a circuit through the battery, cable, and earth, can be so observed as to furnish a curve
representing very accurately the arrival of an electric current. Lines representing successive
signals at various speeds can also be obtained, and, by means of a metronome, dots and dashes
can be sent with nearly perfect regularity by an ordinary Morse key, and the corresponding
changes in the current at the receiving end of the cable accurately observed.

A system of arbitrary characters, similar to those used upon the Morse telegraph, was employed,
and the letter to be indicated was determined by the number of oscillations of the needle,
as well as by the length of time during which the needle remained in one place. The operator,
who watched the reflection of the deflected needle in the mirror, held a key in his hand communicating
with a local instrument in the office, which he pressed down or raised, according to the deflection
of the needle; and another operator deciphered the characters thus produced upon the paper.
This mode of telegraphing was, of necessity, very slow, and it will not surprise the reader
that the fastest rate of speed over the cable did not exceed three words per minute. Still,
had the old cable continued in operation a few months longer, experience and practice would
have enabled the operator to transmit and receive with very much greater facility. On our land-lines,
operators of long experience acquire a dexterity which enables them not only to transmit and
receive telegrams with wonderful rapidity, but to work the instruments during storms, when
those of less experience would be unable to receive a dot.
