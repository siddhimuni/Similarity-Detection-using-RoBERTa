There must be a willingness between a husband and wife to "give and take" and share in building a successful marriage.  If they don't, little 
problems they encounter will soon escalate into huge fights.  A wife should not simply obey without question; the husband should not rule with an iron fist, but be a thoughtful head of the household. And neither party should be pressured to ignore their personal principles and morals.  

Here are a few sound rules:  

1. The husband should give his spouse a generous allowance every week and define to the wife what the money is earmarked for.  

2. Invite mutual friends into your home, and do not allow them to rob you and your wife of the quality time you need to cultivate a successful    relationship. 

3. Attend church together regularly.  If that is not possible, make certain one spouse goes each Sunday.  Take communions consistently because
this will strengthen your union in the eyes of God.  

4. A father is an extremely strong role model for children, especially the boys.  Do not depend on your wife or the school to provide your children
with spiritual training.  Do not sit home.  Go to church with your children. 

5. Men, in general, have a responsibility to home, church and country.  Their first priority is to the family.  But be mindful of other commitments.
You will be rewarded, spiritually, for your loyalty and work in the church. And, as a Christian, you should give something back to help others as well as enjoying the blessings that the church bestows upon you and your family. God does not want robots. Everyone should contribute for the good of all.   And finally, though your individual power might be small, your country still needs you to express your opinions -- whatever your beliefs might be -- to benefit the entire nation.
