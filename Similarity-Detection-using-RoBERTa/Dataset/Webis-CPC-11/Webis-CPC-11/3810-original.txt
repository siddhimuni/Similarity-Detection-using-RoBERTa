I am afraid it is not a very
dignified confession for an elderly matron to make, but those impromptu gymnastics on forms
are amongst the most delightful recollections of my childhood. The little girls of the present
day practise calisthenics, and perform wonderful feats with ropes and giant strides; I hope
they know something of the delight we used to get out of our deftly-arranged forms.

As I have already said, however, afternoon school is a thing unknown to the majority of the
fortunate girls who attend our high schools and collegiate establishments. According to present
arrangements girls reach school at half-past nine, and they remain till half-past one, having
an interval of half an hour between eleven and twelve for rest and refreshment. Then the pupils
separate, and the elder ones go home with any amount of "home work" to prepare, while the younger
ones remain at school to learn their home lessons with the assistance of the teachers. It is
with the necessities of these young ones who remain that I am just now concerned. Very often
dinner is provided for them at the school, and a few partake of it there under the superintendence
of a teacher who is told off for the duty. It is my experience, however, that only a small
proportion of the whole number of those who stay avail themselves of this opportunity. Either
the price charged is too high, or conversation is too much restricted, or from some other reason
girls for the most part prefer to bring food with them "for luncheon," and postpone a proper
meal until they reach home.
