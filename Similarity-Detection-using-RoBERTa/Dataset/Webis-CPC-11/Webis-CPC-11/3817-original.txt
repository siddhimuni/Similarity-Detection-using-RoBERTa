The dressmakers' apprentices in a great city have another alternative;
and it is quite as much to escape from the intolerable labours which are imposed upon them
in the London season, as from any sexual frailty, that such multitudes of them adopt a vocation
which affords some immediate relief, whilst it ensures a doubly fatal termination of their
career. The temptations by which these girls are beset might be deemed all-sufficient, without
the compulsion by which they are thus as it were, driven out into the streets. Upon them, "the
fatal gift of beauty" has been more lavishly bestowed than upon any other class--perhaps not
excepting even the aristocracy. They are many of them, probably, the spurious offspring of
aristocratical fathers, and inherit beauty for the same reason as the legitimate daughters
of aristocrats, because the wealth of these persons enables them to select the most beautiful
women either for wives or for concubines. Nor are they wanting in the grace and simplicity
of manner which distinguish the aristocracy; whilst constant manual occupation produces in
them more vacuity of mind than even that which dissipation causes in their sisters of the superior
class. They are thus possessed of exterior attractions, which will at any moment place them
in a condition of comparative affluence, and keep them in it so long as those attractions last,--a
period beyond which their portion of thought and foresight can scarcely be expected to extend:
whilst, on the other hand, they have before them a most bitter and arduous servitude, constant
confinement, probably a severe task-mistress (whose mind is harassed and exacerbated by the
exigent and thoughtless demands of her employers), and a destruction of health and bloom, which
the alternative course of life can scarcely make more certain or more speedy.
