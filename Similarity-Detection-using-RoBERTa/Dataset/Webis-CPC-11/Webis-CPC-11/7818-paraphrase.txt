In the past, I used to play that royal game, but lately I have given it up. Now, it's no game at all, but a tiresome, but tempting science; just as cricket is artilery combat now, and football is very dangerous, and boating huts the athlete's sentiment, and billiards can only be played by a pro of bar spots, and the tranquil which itself became a somewhat fraudulent system of secret signs, and open rules; even so the logical, honest game of chess has come to be so full of known openings and plays and other growths upon the good house-plant, that i for one have rejected it, as a pursuit for which life is too short and serious (give me a story or a joke instead) and one too in which any fool well book hgamves may lord over the wisest of men with eas because of the checkmate. However, in this connectionl I remember a little experience which proves that ignorance of famous openers may be an advantage sometimes; just like a skilled fencer will be baffled by a brave boor running in against rules, and by close encounter unconventionally pinning him right away. When younger, before matriculation, O was a guest of Culham, the rector, a very proud chess player who thought he wasn't defeatable, because nobody around him could defeat him. so he thought he'd make a quick victory of a thoughtful but stammering boy, by tempting him early in the game to capture a knight (his usual play it appeared) which could have ensured a defeat later. I declined the offer, which started to nag my opponent, but theni  refused to answer divers moves by the card, and finally checkmated him. He flew into a rage, that I wouldn't play again, his "revenge" would possibly be too terrible.
