At home, the government was in a state of complete confusion, although the country was at war with France, and France in alliance with Austria, and these two nations have departed from its policy for two centuries and a half, so that they can crush Frederic of Prussia, England's allies. Frederic was defeated in Kolin, the Austrians, on June 18, and a Russian army was in occupation of East Prussia.

Then it was a new spirit breathed into the British marine, through which it has since been animated, and has rarely stopped to count the odds. Then began to rush the companies that made almost all of England who was assailable, from Gor√©e to Cuba and from Cuba to the Philippines.
