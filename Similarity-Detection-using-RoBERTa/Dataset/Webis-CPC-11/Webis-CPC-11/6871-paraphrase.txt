The way the engine operates, the amount of gas it consumes, and the load on the engine are carefully observed and noted every 20 minutes. 
Hourly there's a record kept of the amount of water the gas engine uses as well as its temperature coming in and going out of the engine jackets.

Every two hours indicator cards are taken.

It's ongoing work and there are three shifts each day.  The shifts are 8 hours, but the test length depends upon the kind of fuel that's being used.

An initial study of the different coals unearthed from different areas of the U. S. is almost ready and has been directed by Mr. Alfred H. White.  A report will be issued soon.

Liquid Fuels Tested.  Mr. R. M. Strong is directing a test of liquid fuels and how they perform in internal-combustion engines and that's being done in Building 13's engine room.

Different hydro-carbon fuels range from light refined oils like naphtha, to crude types of petroleum, and their features vary accordingly in their physical and chemical makeup.

The best ones for use in internal combustion engines are light and refined, such as gasoline, or are made of alcohol.

However, these are the most costly for commercial purposes, even when they're used conservately, which practices have been utilized already.

Right now no one knows exactly the number of the cheaper distiliates and crudes that could be used in these types of engines.

They're very hard to use even if they would be efficient.

In comparison, gasoline has a constant quality and can be used efficiently in any high quality gasoline engine.
