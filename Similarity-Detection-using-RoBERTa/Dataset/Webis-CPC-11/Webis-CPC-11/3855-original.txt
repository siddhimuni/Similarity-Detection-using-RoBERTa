Underline a special desire, sir, next week? Elliston. No, Sam., I fear our special
desires are nearly threadbare.

Prompter's boy calling in at the door. Mr. Octavius Clarke would be glad to speak with Mr.
Elliston.

ELLISTON. He be d----d! Silence that noise between Messrs. Winston and Bunn--and turn out Waterloo
Tom.

MADAME VESTRIS. My dear Elliston, do you mean to keep us here all day?

~368~~ELLISTON (whispering). I had rather keep you all night, madame.

SHERWIN (to G. Smith). I wish it may be true that one of our comedians is going to the other
house; I shall then stand some chance for a little good business--at present I have only two
decent parts to my back.

LISTON (as stiff as a poker). If I pass an opinion, I must have an increase of salary; I never
unbend on these occasions.

MRS. ORGER (to the author). This part is not so good as Sally Mags. I must take my friend's
opinion in the city.

MISS STEPHENS (laughing). I shall only sing one stanza of this ballad--it's too sentimental.

MISS SMITHSON (aside, but loud enough for the manager to hear). Ton my honour, Mr. Elliston
never casts me any thing but the sentimental dolls and la la ladies.

G-- SMITH (in a full bass voice). Nor me any thing but the rough cottagers and banditti men;
but, never mind, my bass solo will do the trick.

GATTIE (yawning). I wish it was twelve o'clock, for I'm half asleep, and I've made a vow never
to take snuff before twelve; if you don't believe me, ask Mrs. G. After the hit I made in Monsieur
Tonson, it's d--d hard they don't write more Frenchmen.
