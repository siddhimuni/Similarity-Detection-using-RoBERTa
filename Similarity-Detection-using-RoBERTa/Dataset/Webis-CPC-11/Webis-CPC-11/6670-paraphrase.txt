About the name Mona, in regard to Man and Anglesea, I suspect it might come from Sanscrit. It might mean to know, worship etc, where we get Brahma's son Manu, Minos, Menu, Menes, Moonshee, and Monk.

Mona was used as a name for the two islands, which were particularly the location of Druids. This name most likely comes from the Celtic wisemen, Trow-wys, or the Saxon dru, a soothsayer. This is very similar to the mooni, or holy person and scholar of the Sanscrit. This leads me to another question: Could it be that these two Monas, the dwelling of piety and precepts be the true institure of the ancients?
