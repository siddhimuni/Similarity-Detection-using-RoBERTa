When metals were passed through a spectroscope after being vaporized in the extreme heat of the electric arc, the lines in the solar spectrum were finally explained.  Using this technique you could see the spectra of metals were composed of bright lines in the same places where dark lines are seen in the sun's spectrum.   To see a reversal of this, while metals are being vaporized pass through the vapor rays of light from the sun allowing them into a spectroscope.  Now the original black bands reappear.  "Vapors of all elements absorb the same ray of light which they emit when incandescent" - is now a law of nature.  Each element has it's own unique spectrum of lines and widths.  Scientists memorize these individual spectrums - if they were to watch something burn through a spectroscope, he/she can tell you what that element is.  Using this new law of nature, scientists have discerned that the entire universe is composed of the same materials found on earth ie: calcium, hydrogen, magnesium, sodium, iron, etc....  Because vaporized iron filters all rays emitted from melted iron as do the gasses of all the other elements of the sun, light is radiated in unison within each element.  Within the atmosphere of the sun you can find vaporized metals. The light from the liquid metals beneath is not allowed to pass through their vaporized form above thus causing black lines to be seen in the solar spectrum.  Man has learned to read these lines of radiated light; the alphabet of the universe.
