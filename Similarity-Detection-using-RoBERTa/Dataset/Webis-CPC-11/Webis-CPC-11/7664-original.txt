The island of Lobau was first strongly fortified, and then, not
one, but numerous bridges were constructed to the mainland on the left bank under cover of
the guns. Lower down similar measures were taken. In this way the French troops could effect
their passage very rapidly and much farther eastward than before, avoid the Aspern-Essling
line, and reaching Enzersdorf under protection of their own forts, turn the enemy's left almost
in the act of crossing, and so roll up the left wing of his line, which was strongly posted
on high ground behind the Russbach, from Markgrafneusiedl through Parbasdorf toward Wagram,
where it was connected with the center. These arrangements were all completed by July first,
on which date the Emperor left Sch√∂nbrunn for the Lobau.
