How awful! I keep forgetting old customs and traditions.

FREDERICH: For heaven’s sake, Erna dear, please do not use that tone of voice.

RITA: What do you mean by that? Which ‘tone of voice’, pray?

FREDERICH: Please try not to make things more difficult for me than they are, Erna. Don’t you realize that I spent a great deal of energy searching for you? I even used an agency in Berlin. When I found you were the famous Revera, I was shocked. You can imagine what a terrible blow this discovery this was to me. I was ready to give up every thing. But I got over my worst fears. I well understood that you lived in comfortable circumstances. I wondered if you would still remember the world in which I live. I feared that you might have become a stranger to it by now. I dared not hope that we could ever understand each other. 

RITA:  Well, may be I can guess what was in your mind when you searched for me. I wonder in what circumstances you would have wished to find me. Perhaps you imagined that you will find me eking out a living as seamstress, in dire need. Perhaps you thought that I, though poor and keeping body and soul together with my sewing, would have lead a respectable life. That was important for you, wasn’t it – respectability? Then, when you found me poor and desperate, hanging on to life in my dreary attic, you would have been only too glad to reach out to me with arms extended, wanting to enclose me in your embrace. You would have imagined that in my gratitude, I would have been only too glad to fall on your bosom and be lovingly clasped in your arms. Will you deny that such were your expectations? Will you deny that you even hoped to find me in such mean and miserable circumstances? 

FREDERICK gives her a calm and icy look.
