Miss Ward was out when Mrs Combermere's equipage drove up to Mr Norman's door; that large lady, with her daughter Bell, accompanied by Mr Newton, made their way up stairs to Mrs Norman's drawing-room.

Mrs. Combermere was always astoundingly grand and patronising when she honoured Cary with a call; Mrs. Combermere liked to call upon folks whom she denominated inferiors--to impress them with an overwhelming idea of her importance.

But on the simple-minded literal Cary, this honour was lost, she received it with such composure and unconscious placidity: on Bab it produced, indeed, the desired effect; but whether it was Mrs Combermere's loud talking and boasting, or Mr. Newton's easy negligence and patronising airs, that caused her to colour and hesitate, it is not possible to define.

Bab was not herself; and she began to be ashamed of living in Pentonville, when Mr Newton spoke of Belgravia.

Miss Ward, who had returned from her shopping excursion, glided into the room unnoticed, in the middle of a description Mr. Newton was giving of a magnificent place, belonging to a dear friend, with whom he had been staying, ere he had the 'unspeakable felicity of meeting Mrs Combermere.'

'Your description is a graphic one, John Blomfield,' said Miss Ward in a low voice close to his ear; 'but how came you here--in this company?'

John Blomfield, alias John Newton, started as if an adder had bitten him, and gazed franticly upon the intruder.

'Miss Ward, madam,' he exclaimed involuntarily, 'don't say more, and I'll go this instant!'

'Then go,' continued Miss Ward majestically, pointing to the door; 'and beware, John Blomfield, how you dare to enter a gentleman's house unauthorised again.'

Pale and crest-fallen, the young gentleman and dear friend of Lady Mary Manvers vanished; nor did he require a second bidding to rush down stairs, and out at the front-door, which was slammed violently after him.
