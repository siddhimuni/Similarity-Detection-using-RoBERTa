The thirst for gold precedes the desire for instruction and a taste for the things of old.  Remarkably, in all of the mountainous parts of South America, from Merida and Santa Martha, across the table-lands of Quito and Upper Peru, many laborers have undertaken the great tasks of discovering and extracting tombs with masses of gold.  According to history, there was no trace of these precious metals in the caverns that served the people of Guiana for centuries as sepulchers. Although, the Caribs as well as other travelling nations made incursions into the south-west areas, gold only flowed in very small amounts from the mountains of Peru towards the eastern plains.
Based on history, the Indians bury their dead inside the earth.  They place their people inside of large cavities, which have been formed by the process of decomposition. The Indians are known for burying the dead wherever the granitic rocks are not or by an accumulation of their blocks, The hammock (also called a chinchorro), which is used for resting and relaxing during their life may also serve as a net or a coffin when they die. This net is wrapped tightly around the body, a hole is made in the hut, and here is where the body is laid. According to Missionary Gili, this is the method that is traditionally used.  Also, based on information that Father Zea has provided, I do not believe that there is one tumulus in Guiana, the plains of Cassiquiare or Essequibo.
