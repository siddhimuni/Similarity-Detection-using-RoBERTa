We were shown some of the incredible drawings of Sir Robert, at only twenty he was alread gaining an artist's reputation and getting attentions of West and Shee. What a wonderful way to pass the hours.His picture of Storming of Seringapatam, which was already know around half the world, was inspired and explained to us.Let us tell you though, the Porters spoke only kindly of each other, without the family ego others show.They lavished praise on others work while never mentioning their own or each others.They told tales of pleasure in their trips to London, against their mothers advice that young ladies with out wealth should live a calm and quiet life in the country, staying far from the temptations of luxury and city life.We smiled at the thought"young ladies" that was 22 years ago and Jane Porter was 75 when she died. They shared much about their former life at Thamed Ditton, the sweet neighborhood they loved. However both their mother's health and their's had improved since the move back to Esher-hill, to their little garden backed up to beautiful Claremont park.The front of the house overlooked the roads leading to the town broken up by the village green and statly elms.
