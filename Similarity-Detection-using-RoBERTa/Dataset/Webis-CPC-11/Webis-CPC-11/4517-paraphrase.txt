A major cause of complaint was the secrecy of the Inquisition's procedure.

However, there were still defenders, despite the horrors of it. Some of the defenders used absurd arguments in defense of the Inqusition: "Paramo, in the quaint pedantry with which he ingeniously proves that God was the first Inquisitor, and the condemnation of Adam and Eve the first model of the Inquisitorial process, triumphantly points out that he judges them in secret, thus setting the example which the Inquisition is bound to follow, and avoiding the subtleties which the criminals would have raised in their defence, especially at the suggestion of the crafty serpent. That he called no witnesses is explained by the confession of the accused, and ample legal authority is cited to show that these confessions were sufficient to justify the conviction and punishment."[NOTE: Copy/pasted quote from source]

Prisoners who were stalwart in their refusal to confess were the recipients of the worst torture. Legally, torture could only be performed once, but this rule was easy to bypass. A number of tortures could legally be inacted in sequence, and if more evidence was unearthed, the torture could be performed again. When the casuists wanted to repeat torture, even after several days, they would use a loophole of calling the new torture a "continuance of the first torture," rather than a repetition of it. This commitment to nuance reveals the malice of the Inquisitors.

There was another difficulty, however. Confessions that were extracted during torture were not legally useful, as noted by Eymeric himself.

If the prisoner repeated his confession after leaving the torture chamber, then his fate was sealed. A problem, though, was what to do if he retracted his confession?
