The free education available in the liberal city of Besancon is quite stunning, potentially turning it into one of the most important academic centers in the country. 

Let's take, for instance, the breathtakingly beautiful Granvelles palace. The unsuspecting visitor might linger to admire its glorious architecture, and, upon a closer look, might also discover that it houses two pieces attributed to the famous Spanish painter Velasquez. The two paintings, titled “Galileo” and the “Mathematician”, are still under expert investigation, to decide whether they were done by the master himself or a pupil from his school; however, the first clues indicate it's quite likely these were painted by Velasquez. 

Once our visitor is done admiring these obvious attractions, he might be surprised to find that the  Granvelles palace is home to another treasure: the free art school, which was inaugurated in the last decade of the 18th century, and has prospered ever since. 

Besancon also has a music school, various technical schools and a full Academy of Science and Belle Lettres – all of which provide courses free of charge to students who do not have the financial means to pay for their education. Besides, in one of the most liberal settings conceivable, the courses are open to participants of both sexes. Any high school graduate who wants to try out for the degree in sciences or liberal arts can do so here, again, free of charge. The number of opportunities thus opened to underprivileged pupils can not be overestimated. 

For those who have always wanted to participate in the elevated winter series organized by the Royal Institution, but found the fees prohibitive, there is now a series of free lectures, open to everybody, at the Academy in  Besancon, organized from October until June.
