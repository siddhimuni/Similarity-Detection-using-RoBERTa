I refer for instances to the
Convention Act, the Insurrection Act, the Gunpowder Act, and the Press Bill, a measure which,
in my enumeration of the violent steps taken by the Irish government, escaped me, though perhaps
it is, of all the dreadful groupe, the most prominent and most fatal to liberty and the constitution.--The
other reason on which my opinion rests is, because administration have persevered in that system
without making any one effort to allay discontent or satisfy the moderate and loyal part of
the community by the concession of any of those measures on which the heart of the nation was
fixed--because they have gone on in opposition to the sense of the best men in the empire to
force the people of Ireland, or the discontented part of it, into open and avowed rebellion,
rather than try any means to prevent that catastrophe by conciliating measures--because this
intention was avowed and gloried in[2]--and, finally, because from the outset of their career
they have resorted to military coercion in every case where they could find, or create, the
slightest pretence for the use of that dreadful engine.

The flame which by these means has been kindled in Ireland can be extinguished but in one of
two ways--either the rebels aided by the power of France will succeed in wresting Ireland from
the British connection, or the military force with which the Irish government is entrusted
will stifle in blood the discontents of the country. Of the first there is happily no danger.
The numbers of the insurgents is much too small to endanger the connection, and that moderate
and loyal party, which administration have hitherto treated with contempt, is too strong and
too much attached to the present form of government, notwithstanding what they had suffered,
either to be overcome by the force, or seduced by the artifice of disaffection, to forego their
allegiance. There remains then only the other alternative--and of that what will be the effect?
Rebellion will be quelled by power, but the existing causes of discontent--those causes which
through a long series of petty conflicts have at length terminated in the present dreadful
issue, will remain rankling in the bosom of the country.
