FROM BUFFALO THE CAPTIVES WERE TAKEN BY WATER TO DETROIT, WHERE THEIR RECEPTION IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS ENTHUSIASTIC THAN IN THE OTHER CITIES THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED. IT WAS STATED IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE DAY, THAT THEY WERE BURNT IN EFFIGY IN THAT PLACE. BLACK HAWK, IN VISITING THE THE FORMER RESIDENCE OF GOVERNOR CASS, REMARKED, "THIS IS THE OLD COUNCIL GROUND. I HAVE HAD MUCH GOOD COUNSEL HERE; BUT MY TRAIL LED TO THE OPPOSITE SHORE, AND MY EARS WERE CLOSED." THEIR VISIT TO DETROIT BEING OVER, THEY PROCEEDED TO GREEN BAY, AND THENCE DESCENDED THE WISCONSIN TO THE MISSISSIPPI AND DOWN THAT RIVER TO FORT ARMSTRONG, ON ROCK ISLAND, WHICH PLACE THEY REACHED ABOUT THE FIRST OF AUGUST. IN PASSING BY THE SITE OF THE OLD SAC VILLAGE, BLACK HAWK WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED, AND EXPRESSED MUCH REGRET FOR THE CAUSES WHICH COMPELLED HIM TO EMIGRATE BEYOND THE MISSISSIPPI. THE RETURN OF THE PROPHET WAS ALSO ATTENDED WITH MELANCHOLY ASSOCIATIONS. HIS VILLAGE OVER WHICH HE HAD LONG PRESIDED, WAS ENTIRELY BROKEN UP--HIS WIGWAM IN ASHES--HIS FAMILY DISPERSED, AND, HE, A SUPPLIANT FOR A HOME IN THE VILLAGE OF SOME OTHER CHIEF. 
FORT ARMSTRONG, WAS CHOSEN BY MAJOR GARLAND AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SPOT FOR THE CEREMONIES OF THE LIBERATION OF BLACK HAWK AND HIS PARTY; AS ITS CENTRAL POSITION, WOULD ENABLE HIM TO ASSEMBLE, AT A SHORT NOTICE, MANY INDIANS FROM THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES. THIS WAS THE FAVORITE ISLAND OF THE INDIANS; IN FORMER YEARS ABUNDANT IN FRUITS AND FLOWERS; AND, FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THE FANCIED ABODE OF A GOOD SPIRIT, WHICH WATCHED OVER THEIR VILLAGE, AND PROTECTED THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS. NO SPOT COULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED, CALCULATED TO AWAKEN SO MANY PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS IN THE MIND OF BLACK HAWK, AS ROCK ISLAND. FOR HALF A CENTURY IT HAD BEEN THE WITNESS OF HIS POWER AND INFLUENCE; IT WAS NOW TO BECOME THE SCENE OF HIS DISGRACE, AND RELUCTANT SUBMISSION TO A RIVAL. 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAJOR GARLAND'S ARRIVAL AT FORT ARMSTRONG, HE SENT OUT RUNNERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSEMBLING THE NEIGHBORING INDIANS. THE MESSENGER DESPATCHED FOR KEOKUK AND HIS CHIEFS, FOUND THEM ENCAMPED ABOUT TWENTY MILES BELOW THE ISLAND, HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM A BUFFALO HUNT, AND BEING ON THEIR WAY TO FORT ARMSTRONG, IN EXPECTATION OF MEETING THE RETURNING CAPTIVES. THE RUNNER RETURNED THAT NIGHT, AND REPORTED TO MAJOR GARLAND, THAT ON THE MORROW, KEOKUK WITH A PARTY OF BRAVES WOULD REACH ROCK ISLAND. ABOUT NOON, ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE SOUND OF THE INDIAN DRUM, AND THE SHOUTS AND WILD SONGS OF HIS PEOPLE, ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THE PRINCELY KEOKUK. HE ASCENDED THE MISSISSIPPI BY WATER, AND LED THE VAN WITH TWO LARGE CANOES, LASHED SIDE BY SIDE, HANDSOMELY DECORATED, WITH A CANOPY ERECTED OVER THEM, BENEATH WHICH SAT THE CHIEF AND HIS THREE WIVES, WITH THE AMERICAN FLAG WAVING OVER THEM. MORE THAN TWENTY CANOES FOLLOWED THE CHIEFTAIN, EACH CONTAINING FROM FOUR TO EIGHT OF HIS WARRIORS, WHOSE SHOUTS AND SONGS, SWEPT OVER THE TRANSPARENT WATERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI, AND WERE ECHOED FROM SHORE TO SHORE. THIS FLEET OF CANOES, WAS ROWED SLOWLY UP THE STREAM, UNTIL IT PASSED THE CAMP OF THE CAPTIVES; IT THEN RETURNED AND THE PARTY LANDED ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER, OPPOSITE TO THE CAMP OF BLACK HAWK. HERE KEOKUK AND HIS PARTY SPENT SEVERAL HOURS IN ARRANGING THEIR DRESS, PAINTING THEIR FACES AND EQUIPPING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR IMPLEMENTS OF WAR.
