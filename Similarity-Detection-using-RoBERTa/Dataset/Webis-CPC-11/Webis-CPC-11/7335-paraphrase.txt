Leclerc printed the Ami des Lois, and he was requested by the adjutant to publish it on March 4, a day after the publication by Louallier.  Following it came a notice that since New Orleans and its surrounding area was under martial law it was therefore it was important that the section be given the information so all would have it.

Jackson must have been very happy when others persuaded him that Louallier could be tried as a spy.

He was prosecuted, Eaton tells us, as a person who should have been loyal to the United States. 
Because he did owe that loyalty, Eaton says he shouldn't have been prosecuted as a spy.  He was, after all a legislator, meaning he certainly was a citizen.  Citizens exhibiting such behaviors as he was accused of should have been prosecuted on the bigger offense of being a traitor.

This is the argument that Judge Martin gives, in a short but pithy statement.  But, no matter which he was accused of, Louallier was arrested on Sunday, March 5, at twelve noon by the Exchange Coffee House.

He asked that the bar provide him legal relief and applied to our author, Judge Martin, who was a member of the state Supreme Court.

However, the judge didn't think he had the proper jurisdiction so didn't do anything.  But Hall, who was District United States Judge, was asked for a writ of habeas corpus and gave it.

The General was informed by the judge through his attorney of the writ.

When he got Morel's missive, Jackson was so angry that he lost control of himself in his rage.
