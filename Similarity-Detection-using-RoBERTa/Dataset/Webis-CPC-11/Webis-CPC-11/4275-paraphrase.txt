All human achievemnt requires willingness to find a better way to do things.   Archiac ideas must be replaced with new innovative ones.  To succeed you must have an indomitable spirit that will withstand failure and the courage to keep on trying even when things seem unattainable.  All these things are needed if one is going ot succeed in any venture.

We must work together to make the world a better place.  Cooperation is essential if we are going to overcome the struggles that allow some to only live at a subsistence level.  Every day the news is full of stories of conflict that bring heartache to many.  It is time that the world needs be met by a new restructuring of world economics.  It is unfair that only the most powerful determine the distribution of resources, credit and consumption. 

There might be debate on such an idea,b ut the time has come and necessity dictates change. We need to improve the political structure of human society in order  to meet man's desire for change and improvement.  Attaining this change will bring more freedom to masses and lesson their limitations in life.  We can be limited by things that we cannot control like our physical and mental limitations, but we can lessen the economic bonds by economic liberation. The pursuit of happiness should not just be a dream, nor should clothing, food, shelter, and comfort.  The time to change is now!
