The "augment of camps and plots"? Okay then! Let us learn in a martial school; How good is your Bisleys and Dovers. If the whole game resolves in manipulation? To manipulate that game longer and pay for it too, Sir, Won't suit me at all. I feel disgusted and spiritless. Your kicks for my halfpence? I'm afraid it won't do, Sir! And therefore, old Tapenoddle--take back the sword!

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY. 

[CONTINUED.] 


March 11.--I have to be little careful in my speech to the Council. Must impress Billsbury like fun. How would this do? "I am young, Gentlemen, but I should have studied the political history of my country to little purpose if I did not know that, till the last election, the vote of Billsbury was always on the side of enlightenment and Constitutional progress.The unguarded and foolish experiments of those who sought to impair the glorious fabric of our laws and our Constitution found no interest in Billsbury. It was not your fault, I know, that this state of things has not been maintained, and that Billsbury is now whining under the heavy burden of a distasteful representation. Far be it from me to say one word personally against the present Member for Billsbury. This is a political fight, and it is because his political opinions are mistaken that you have decided to attack him"--&c., &c., &c. Must throw in something about Conservatives being the true friends of working-men. CHUBSON is not an Eight Hours' man, so I can go a long way. What shall I say next? Church and State, of course, Ireland pacified and contented, glorious financial successes of present Government, steady removal of all legitimate grievances, and triumphs of our diplomacy in all parts of the world. Shall have to say a good word for Liberal-Unionists. TOLLAND says there are about thirty of them, all very precarious.
