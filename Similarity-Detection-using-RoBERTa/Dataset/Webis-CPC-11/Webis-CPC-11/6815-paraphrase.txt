A kerosene lamp has been unjustly blamed for many accidents, although it does need special care in order not to be knocked over.  That's why these lamps are involved in more fires than electric lights.  It's the carelessness of the people around.  Fire insurance providers know this, and their statistics show that these lamps cause many more fires than other kinds of lights.

There won't be any danger to it if the lamp is made right with a close fitting wick and it's put out by lowering the flame and blowing across its chimney.  Then only breaking or overturning will result in a problem.

Mineral is used today in oil lamps and it has a flashing point higher than 75 degrees F.
Petrolium is dangerous because it contains 
highly volatile ingredients that combust at ordinary temperatures.  Kerosene is a mineral oil that needs not to be too volatile and therefore shouldn't emit a flammable vapor at less than 120 degrees F.  It should rest in its reservoir and then be drawn up to the burner to be used correctly.

Then it is turned by the flame's heat into a hydrogen/hydrocarbon gas mix that is consumed by the air's oxygen.  If this is done correctly, carbon dioxide and water vapor are the end result.
