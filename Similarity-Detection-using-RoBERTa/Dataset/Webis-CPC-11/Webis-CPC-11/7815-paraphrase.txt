But still the opposite predetermined of opinions, diffused again the earth with the tricolor flag, maintain their ground with the great majority even of well-informed men, at lowest within everybody democratic states and constitutional monarchies. The policy of England within advocating the revolutions of Belgium, Portugal, Spain, and the South American republics, has, for the last thirty years, been mainly founded onto the belief, that institutions allied towards those of Britain may with safety be moved towards else states, and that it is among them independently that we are towards glance for durable alliances or cordial support. The miserable providence of everybody the countries, strangers towards the Anglo-Saxon blood, whom possess been cursed with these alien constitutions, whether within the Spanish or Italian Peninsulas, or the South American states--the jealous mettle and frequent undisguised violence of America--the gross failure of English institutions within Ireland, possess had none influence with the great majority of men within this nation, within rooting out these fatal errors. More than one generation, it is obvious, ought go down towards their graves ahead of they are moderately expelled from general idea via experience and suffering. So obstinately do men cling towards doctrines, which are flattering towards human vanity, within dissent alike towards the dictates of wisdom and the lessons of experience; and so true within everybody ages is the doctrine of the Roman Catholic church, that pride is the last sin which can be conquered within the human heart. 
One remarkable example shall illustrate the method within which Montesquieu backed the opposite beliefs, that institutions are moulded via the spirit and conditions of countries, not the moulders of them. It is well known that primogeniture, although nor the law of series within the Roman empire, nor originally of the countries of Northern Europe, within whom the allodial customs at former loosely prevailed, arrived towards be universally introduced with the feudal system, and the radical establishment of a combat aristocracy within every nation of Europe.
