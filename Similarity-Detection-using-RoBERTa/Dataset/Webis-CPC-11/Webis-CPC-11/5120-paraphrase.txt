Definetly we had a better right to expect at the hands of Hunt a drawing of that remarkable writer, than of Coleridge, of whom he saw comparatively little. We also expected to find some allusion to the "Round Table," a series of essays which appeared in the Examiner, about 1815, written mainly by Hazlitt, but among which are about 12 by Hunt himself, some of them perhaps the best things he wrote: we need only allude to "A Day by the Fire," a paper eminently characteristic of the author, and we doubt not fully appreciated by those who know his writings. Hunt regrets having re-employ the "Story of Rimini," and tells us that a new edition of the poem is meditated, in which, while retaining the improvement in the versification, he offers to restore the narrative to its first course.
We take leave of the work, with a few more characteristic passages.

COOKE'S EDITION OF THE BRITISH POETS.--In those times, Cooke's version of the British writers came up. I had got an odd amount of Spenser; and I fell in love with Collins and Gray. How I adored those little sixpenny numbers, containing whole writers! I doated on their size; I doated on their type, on their ornaments, on their wrappers containing lists of other writers, and on the engraving from Kirk. I bought them over and over again, and used to get up select sets, which disappeared like buttered biscuits; for I could resist neither giving them away nor having them. When the master tormented me, when I used to hate and be jealous of the sight of Homer, and Demosthenes, and Cicero, I would comfort myself with thinking of the sixpence in my pants pocket, with which I should go out to Paternoster Row, when school was over, and purchase another number of an English poet.

KID'S BOOKS: "SANDFORD AND MERTON."--The children's books in those days were Hogarth's pictures taken in their most literal acceptation. Every good boy was to ride in his coach, and be a lord mayor; and every bad boy was to be hung, or eaten by lions. The gingerbread was gilt, and the books were gilt like the gingerbread: an intake the more gross, inasmuch as nothing could be plainer or less dazzling than the books of the same boys when they grew a little more aged. There was a lingering old ballad or so in favor of the gallanter apprentices who tore out lions' hearts and astonished gazing sultans; and in antiquarian corners, Percy's "Reliques" were preparing a nobler age, both in writing and prose. But the first counteraction came, as it ought, in the shape of a new book for children. The pool of mercenary and time-serving ethics was first blown over by the fresh countryside breeze of Mr. Day's "Sandford and Merton," a production that I well remember, and shall ever be thankful for. It came in aid of my mom's perplexities, between delicacy and hardihood, between courage and conscientiousness. It assisted the happiness I inherited from my dad; showed me that circumstances were not to check a healthy gaiety, or the most masculine self-respect; and helped to supply me with the resolution of standing by a principle, not merely as a point of lowly or lofty sacrifice, but as a matter of common sense and duty, and a simple co√∂peration with the elements natural warfare.

CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.--Maybe there is not foundation in the country so really English, taking that word to mean what Englishmen want it to mean:--something rock-hard, unimaginable, of good character, and free to all. More boys are to be found in it, who issue from a greater variety of ranks, than in any other school in the kingdom and as it is the most various, so it is the biggest, of all the free schools. Nobility do not go there except as boarders. Now and then a boy of a noble family may be met with, and he is reckoned an interloper, and against the charter; but the sons of poor gentry and London citizens abound; and with them, an evenly equal share is given to the sons of tradesmen of the very humblest description, not omitting slaves.
