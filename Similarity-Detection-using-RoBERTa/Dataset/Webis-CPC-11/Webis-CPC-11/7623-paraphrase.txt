Weyburn personally delivered the communication to Dr. Rewkes. From his point of view, Lord Ormont didn't seem to need immediate medical attention. He told Lady Charlotte the significance of the summons after explaining his tardiness.
She said he hadn't yet arrived. She then suggested that we chat together while we wait for him. The status of his bile I know not. I'm not buying what he says to others. Especially what he says regarding Lady Ormont. Morsfield notwithstanding, he's in a tough spot now, like the dragonflies that Bobby my grandson likes to collect. I'm through talking about him. Steignton is not a place where she's welcome.
