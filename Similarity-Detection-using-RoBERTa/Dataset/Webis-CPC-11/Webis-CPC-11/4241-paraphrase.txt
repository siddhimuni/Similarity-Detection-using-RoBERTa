A child will always play a game for all its worth.  He will try his best to be a good shopkeeper conductor, or banker.

Chapter XXIV

Experiences by means of doing

In Nursery School, activity is the chief characteristic.  One typical form is experimenting with tools and materials, like chalk, paints, scissors, paper, clay, and sand.  The need to experiment and change materials in some way, the need to gratify the muscular senses may be stronger than the desire to build.

The play in Nursery School is often by means of imitation and experiment, and direct help is usually quite unwelcome to a child under six.  There is little to be said of direction but, "Provide suitable material, give freedom, and help, if the child wants it."  But, this is different in the transitional stage.  Children learn to think by doing.  They have a natural inclination to do:  they try, do wrong, consider, examine, observe, and do it again.  Take for example a girl who wants to make a doll's bonnet like a baby's.  She impulsively cuts materials, making it to small, then examines the original bonnet, and makes another attempt.  She stumbles upon the truth, and is able to relate one form to another.    A boy might paint a Christmas card, and copying holly-berries he might notice the beauty of color.  Purposeless observation would not have stirred this appreciation in him.  

Doing and thinking are inextricably linked.  In the eary stages of development, the way to know and feel is often through action:  thus the maxim that handwork is a method.

This idea is often not truly considered, and this has led to a trivial application; A nature lesson of the "look and say" description is followed by a painting lesson;  or a geography lesson by making a model.
