Mr. Haeckel believes that only a few 'monistic materialist' are entitled to argue  against the   evolution. So he avoided all true and intelligent christians, as they cannot be'monistic materialists'. But we were eager to know what he meant by 'highest moment'  as he is person who is not at all ready to hear any religious objections to evolution. He objects all arguements  just by a sentence'all faith is superstition". In his opinion we should only believe in what we see and hear or feel. He says A man should  be well versed with all subjects like Biology ,Zoology, Botany, comparitive anatomy,Geology and Paleontology, to survey the whole field.
      If the facts  related in the  "Book of Nature" is true we have to conclude that Our Great Father left his creatures in utter  state of helplessness . That Mr. Haeckel and someone like him do all the thinking as we are mentally  less capable. Mr. Huxley advises  poor theologians to  give the matter to them. Mr. Haeckel  only allows  a hearing who can comprehend  all subjects mentioned above.  About 99% of the evolutionists  do not have right to speak on the subject. Haeckel is a foolish man as he could not answer the questions asked by the believers.For he thinks that before learning about evolution you must leave all his faith in god,in Bible and in human spirit and in future life.  What point is there to say that a man is only entitled to a hearing only if he renounce his beliefs.Why should we christians not allowed a hearing .  Mr. Huxley  even advices keep our mouth shut.
