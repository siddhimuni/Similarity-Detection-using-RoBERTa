Rich soil is a great source of nutrients for any plants to grow.  Plants growing on a rich soil are generally herbaceous – full of green leaves. They become charged with water more than they can absorb, particularly in cold climate. This leads to imbalance in the stability and proportions of chemicals required to form natural juices at the cost of amount and class of volatile oil produced.


This was mentioned by Linnæus long ago and was proved in England. Few years back, a disease broke out in the plants, which was unknown to the agriculturists and was not treated. Even today, this disease is not understood and cannot be treated. This leads to a decrease in the area available for farming. Along with this, poor harvesting led to the rapid rise in the oil price – from 50s. to 200s. per lb. The demand went on increasing and so was the price. This forced the producer of lavender water and compound perfumes where lavender is an important ingredient, to buy French oil and they started contaminating the English oil with French oil.

Now this adulteration has such a level that it is almost impossible to get pure lavender oil in England, which was available twenty years ago, with minor exceptions of few top business houses.


The chemists have been overpricing the goods and people want to buy cheap products at the expense of quality. This has lead to remarkable increase in French and, even worse, German oil in the market 

In 1880 the prices had risen to 125s per lb. At that time it was predicted by a renowned business house from England that the prices are going to be un affordable unless production is increased. This will lead to the dominance of cheap products in the market and the original product will lose it’s popularity.
