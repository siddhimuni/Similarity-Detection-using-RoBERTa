At Salt Lake City he enchanted the Mormon Elders by anecdotes of THACKERAY'S relations with
their namesake, the London publisher.

At Peoria (Ill.) he kept his audience in roars by recounting the good sayings of his critical
confrère, Sir WILLIAM ROBERTSON NICOLL.

At Philadelphia a very old man, who claimed to be a younger brother of Mr. Rochester (in Jane
Eyre), publicly embraced the illustrious visitor and borrowed two dollars.

The rumour that Mr. SHORTER is to be appointed as our Ambassador in Washington must not be
too lightly dismissed. America often sends us a man of letters--LOWELL, for example, and HAY.
Why should we not return the compliment? It would be a better appointment than many that could
be named.

The fact cannot be concealed that at home the absence of Mr. SHORTER in America is seriously
felt. Fleet Street wears a bereaved air and Dublin is conscious of a poignant loss. As for
our authors, they are in a state of dismay; some, it is true, like mice when the cat is away,
are taking liberties, but most are paralysed by the knowledge that the watchful eye is not
there, the hand, so instant to blame or praise, is resting. Even publishers, normally an insensitive
race are shaken, and books that were to have been issued have been held back. For what is the
use of bringing out new books if C.K.S. is not here to pass definitive comments upon them before
their ink is dry?

England's loss is, however, America's gain. A new cocktail has been named after him.

THE PEACE TREATY.

What really impressed the Germans most of all with the power of the Big Four was the third
clause of Section 3, as given in the Press:--

    "LEFT BANK OF THE RHINE.

    ... Germany must not maintain or construct any fortifications
    less than fifty kilomètres to the East of the Rhine."

Even WILHELM himself never succeeded in reversing the course of this famous river.
