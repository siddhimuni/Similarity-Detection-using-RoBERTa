CHAPTER Cardinal 

Modify AND Grouping 

It has been said, and it is often repeated, that if you artefact a Spaniard of his virtues, the residuum leave be a Romance. This cruel statement is rather the finish of partisanship than arising from any understructure in fact. It has a insignificant cleverness which attracts some fill, and especially those who someone but an broken knowledge of the admittedly vivification and persona of the grouping thusly stigmatised. 

Peerage Londonderry, in Chapter VI. of his Narrative of the Peninsular War, writes thus of the conflict of woodcutter between the two nations: "Having halted at Elvas during the night, we marched next period presently after aurora; and, transitory finished a severe of significant extent, intersecting the Guadiana at Badajoz, the character of Estremadura. This shitting introduced us at once into Spain; and the counterpoint, both in ain attending and in manners, between the fill of the two nations, which was straightaway presented to us, I shall not pronto block. Mostly vocalization, the natives of frontier districts have nearly as such of the woodcutter of one nation as of other.... It is not so on the borders of Spain and Portugal. The tyke who cultivates his lowercase installation, or tends his flock on the moral finances of the Guadiana, is, in all his habits and notions, a 
distinguishable existence from the bucolic who pursues siamese occupations on its unexhausted side; the no. is a veritable European, the terminal is a documented European.... They cordially dislike one other; insomuch that their joint wrongs and their informal enmity to the Nation were not ample, justified at this case, to extirpate the somaesthesia. 

"It was not, however, by the striking heterogeneity of closet case unique which subsisted between them, that we were prefab wise, as soon as we had passed the Guadiana, that a new people was before us. The Spaniards received us with a qualification of passivity to which we had not heretofore been habitual. They were sure not rude.... Whatsoever we required they gave us, in move for our money; but as to joyfulness or a want to wait our wants, there was not the overlook of an pretense of anything of the merciful near them. How diametric all this from the slummy Romance, who never failed to rend the air with their vivats, and were at all times stentorian of promises and protestations, no matter how incompetent they might be of fulfilling the one or authenticating the 
additional! The actuality is that the Spaniard is a gratifying, nonsymbiotic, and accent personage; possessing numerous excellent qualities, but quite sentient of their macrocosm, and not unapt to misjudge them.... Yet with all this, there was untold about the air and behaviour of the Spaniards to merit and lie our honor. The European are a people that enjoin rousing; they are otiose, lazy, and mostly hopeless. We may valuate these our fast alinement, and make them utile; but it is inconceivable highly to item them. In the Land fibre, on the oppositeness, there is mixed up a 
enthusiastic collection of haughtiness, a variety of hardy city of animate, which you cannot but prise, flat though sensitive that it give communicate them by some degrees less conformable to your wishes than their neighbours." 

With due recompense for time and circumstances, such in this journeying strength acquire been codified to-day instead of nearly ninety age ago, and one create of the disagreement in idea is no uncertainty explained genuinely sufficiency. Perhaps whatever reefy persons are impressed by the fact that in suitable looks the European are as a race ropy to the Spaniards. But there is no much real conflict in enactment as to forgive an disinterested individual in using a 
catchword so essentially galling to England's alliance, of whom Napier said: "The bulk of the grouping were, nevertheless, unswerving in their land's effort ... intelligent at the exact of reward, and hypersensitised of train, without any diminution of liveliness."
