He shows truly remarkable insight when he concludes therein that
It is very probable that the spermatic portions of the uterus and its carunculae are naturally suited for separating aerial particles from arterial blood.

These observations premised, we maintain that the blood of the embryo, conveyed by the umbilical arteries to the placenta or uterine carunculae transports to the foetus not only nutritious juice, but also a portion of the nitro-aerial particles: so that the blood of the infant seems to be impregnated with nitro-aerial particles by its circulation through the umbilical vessels in the same manner as in the pulmonary vessels.

Therefore, I think that the placenta should no longer be called a uterine liver, but rather a uterine lung.[34]

Although Mayow's attempted analysis of respiration of the chick embryo in ovo is less than successful, his views on fetal respiration were soon accepted by many, and his tract stands as a great contribution to physiological embryology.

The studies of such individuals as John Standard reporting the weight of various parts of the hen's egg, e.g., the shell, the yolk, the white, reveal the wing of embryological investigation that was increasingly obsessed with quantification and the physicochemical analysis of the embryo and its vital functions.

It was not, however, destined to become immediately the main stream of embryological investigation. For even as the studies of Mayow were in progress, embryology was embarked upon a course leading to preformationism. By the end of the seventeenth century, the idea that the embryo was encased in miniature in either egg or sperm was elevated to a position of Doctrine, and thereafter there was little encouragement to quantitative study of development.
