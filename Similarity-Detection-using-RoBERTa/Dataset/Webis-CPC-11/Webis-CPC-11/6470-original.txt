Wherefore he besought my
child and myself to forgive him. And when <i>Dom. Consul</i> shook his head, and asked whether
he would live and die on the truth of this confession, he answered, "Yes!" and straightway
fell on his side to the earth and gave up the ghost.

Meanwhile time hung heavy with the people on the mountain, who had come from Coserow, from
Zitze, from Gnitze, &c., to see my child burnt, and they all came running down the hill in
long rows like geese, one after the other, to see what had happened. And among them was my
ploughman, Claus Neels. When the worthy fellow saw and heard what had befallen us, he began
to weep aloud for joy; and straightway he too told what he had heard the sheriff say to old
Lizzie in the garden, and how he had promised her a pig in the room of her own little pig,
which she had herself bewitched to death in order to bring my child into evil repute. <i>Summa</i>:
All that I have noted above, and which till <i>datum</i> he had kept to himself for fear of
the question. Hereat all the people marvelled, and greatly bewailed her misfortunes: and many
came, among them old Paasch, and would have kissed my daughter her hands and feet, as also
mine own, and praised us now as much as they had before reviled us. But thus it ever is with
the people. Wherefore my departed father used to say,

    "The people's hate is death,
    Their love, a passing breath!"

My dear gossip ceased not from fondling my child, holding her in his lap, and weeping over
her like a father (for I could not have wept more myself than he wept). Howbeit she herself
wept not, but begged the young lord to send one of his horsemen to her faithful old maid-servant
at Pudgla, to tell her what had befallen us, which he straightway did to please her. But the
worshipful court (for <i>Dom. Camerarius</i> and the <i>scriba</i> had now plucked up a heart,
and had come down from the coach) was not yet satisfied, and <i>Dom. Consul</i> began to tell
the young lord about the bewitched bridge, which none other save my daughter could have bewitched.
Hereto the young lord gave answer that this was indeed a strange thing, inasmuch as his own
horse had also broken a leg thereon, whereupon he had taken the sheriff his horse, which he
saw tied up at the mill; but he did not think that this could be laid to the charge of the
maiden, but that it came about by natural means, as he had half discovered already, although
he had not had time to search the matter thoroughly. Wherefore he besought the worshipful court
and all the people, together with my child herself, to return back thither, where, with God's
help, he would clear her from this suspicion also, and prove her perfect innocence before them all.

Thereunto the worshipful court agreed; and the young lord, having given the sheriff his grey
charger to my ploughman to carry the corpse, which had been laid across the horse's neck, to
Coserow, the young lord got into the cart by us, but did not seat himself beside my child,
but backward by my dear gossip: moreover, he bade one of his own people drive us instead of
the old coachman, and thus we turned back in God His name. <i>Custos Benzensis</i>, who, with
the children, had run in among the vetches by the wayside (my defunct <i>Custos</i> would not
have done so, he had more courage), went on before again with the young folks, and by command
of his reverence the pastor led the Ambrosian <i>Te Deum</i>, which deeply moved us all, more
especially my child, insomuch that her book was wetted with her tears, and she at length laid
it down and said, at the same time giving her hand to the young lord, "How can I thank God
and you for that which you have done for me this day?"
