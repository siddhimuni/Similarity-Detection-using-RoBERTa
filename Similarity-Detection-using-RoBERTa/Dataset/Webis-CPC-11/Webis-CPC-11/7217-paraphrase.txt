I think here we could install a few cupboards with glass shelves, which everyone wants these days.

So...

That's wonderful, Sanin said, let's think about it.  But let me tell you something.  And he steered Frau Lenore and Gemma toward the next room.

The former was a afraid, and the ruler dropped from her hands.  Gemma was also nervous, but she felt better after she looked at Sanin.  He was merely self-confidence and determined.  The women were invited to sit as he stood.  He talked using his hands and ran them through his hair periodicallly.  That's how he told them about his meeting with Polozov, the trek he might take to Wiesbaden, and the possibility of selling the estate.  Just think, he ended, it might not be necessary for me to go to Russia.
And then we can get married sooner than we thought.

Gemma inquired as to when he had to leave.

He answered that it would have to be in an hour and that a carriage was coming to pick him up.

They asked if he'd write.

Right after I've spoken with this woman, he answered.

Frau Lenore asked if she was very wealthy.

Yes, very, because her millionare father left her all his money.

Great, just don't sell your property too cheaply.

Hold your ground and don't let yourself be overwhelmed.  I know you want to marry Gemma soon, but be cautious in your business dealings.
