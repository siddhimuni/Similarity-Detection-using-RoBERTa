Sir Thomas Mitchell, and other Australian travellers, have spoken of their acutely-endowed
guides in terms almost of affection; and Mr Macgillivray relates that, during his stay at Port
Essington, a native named Neinmal became greatly attached to him. The natives of some of the
islands had never seen Europeans before, yet seemed little inclined to acknowledge the superiority
of their visitors. They manifested but little alarm on witnessing the effects of firearms;
and on one occasion attacked two of the ship's boats with a courage and self-reliance extraordinary
under the circumstances. In general characteristics, they resemble the Torres Strait islanders:
some of them friz their hair up into a mop two feet in diameter, wear a comb nearly a yard
long, and bunches of dogs' teeth hanging behind, by way of ornament, and take no little pride
in adorning their persons with paint and tattoo-marks, and flowers and plants of strong odour.

Among contrivances for procuring food, the natives of some of the islands train the sucking-fish
(Echeneis remora) for the chase in the water, as dogs are trained to hunt on land. A line is
made fast to the creature's tail; it is then started in pursuit of prey, and as soon as it
has attached itself to a turtle, or any other 'game,' the line is hauled in, and the prize
secured. While the Rattlesnake lay at anchor, a number of sucking-fishes took up their quarters
under her bottom, and whenever the sailors dropped a bait overboard, it was always seized by
one of the remor√¶, greatly to the annoyance of the anglers on deck.
