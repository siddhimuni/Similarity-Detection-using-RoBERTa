English Naturalist, Sir Joseph Bart Banks, was born in London on February 13th 1743. William Banks, his father, was the son of a doctor in Lincolnshire who in times past had become sheriff of the county and was very involved in the government during his time. Joseph was the son of a rich man.

Joseph enrolled in Oxford University in 1760 where through his knowledge and interests in the natural sciences introduced botanical lectures to the university.

After coming into possession of his father's vast fortune he set out on his first scientific expedition in 1776 to Newfoundland and Labrador. Soon after returning from his short expedition, Captain Cook was sent out to observe the transit of Venus in the Pacific Ocean and Joseph, with the help of Lord Sandwich, joined the expedition. 

The ship provided was the "Endeavour", he made very calculated and careful preparations, seeking profit in every opportunity and brought along Dr. Daniel Solander, a pupil of Linnaeus.

A long voyage of 3 years ensued, difficult times and marvelous discoveries were made by Joseph and he set out on yet another expedition with Cook, but it did not come to pass due to complications.

In 1781 he was honored with the title of  baronet; in 1795, the order of the bath; and in 1797 he joined the privy council. On the 19th of June 1820, Joseph passed away in Isleworth.

He accomplished many things, including becoming president of the Royal Society in which position he did much to progress science in Britain and brought together great scientific minds from all over the world.
