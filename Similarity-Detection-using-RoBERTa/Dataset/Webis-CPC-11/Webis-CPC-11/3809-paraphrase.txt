(P. 118) found a 60deg. in August, even at Boma during dewy nights. The lowest water temperature was 75deg, and. Most 79deg., While the mouth is sometimes 83deg., Tuckey gives 76deg.-77deg., 74deg. up and over the Niagara River, and 73deg. where there are limestone springs. Oxydization iron suddenly ceased after one day of drying, the plants were ready for a trip to England, and meat wrill hard to keep one day in the lowlands is here eatable on the fifth.

While the focus of "indent" has been discussed in my hammock I set to visit a market share quitanda or hard. As I started, women sang

"Lungwa U Ko Ko telemene Mwanza a kwenda Yell."

"The boat arriving at Mwanza (River) same goes to Yell" (rapids). It is part of a chant which the mothers of men now old taught them in childhood, and only reminiscence of the Congo Expedition, whose double boats, Ajojos Brazil, struck their rude minds half a century ago.

These quitandas are frequented by people living on dozens of miles, and give names of days, which consequently everywhere vary. Thus, Boma Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, respectively, are called "Nkenge", "Sona", "Kandu," and "Konzo." This style of dividing time, which is common throughout the infidel West Africa, style is usually a week: so Proyart Loango Abbe tells us that week is four days, and that the fourth men "rest" by hunting and going to market. Tuckey also recognizes the Week "four days" as opposed to weeks of seven days of the Gold Coast.

After a half hour run northwest carry my strong growth shouting "semper et al oh!" dotted in the market place about a hundred souls were assembled.
