And likewise, in the cost of the  performance  their part is  publically   inflicted  them; at the present day,[63103] in the sum-total of 131,000,000 francs which  main   command   charges   yearly  outcome,   the communes  augment  50,000,000 francs; from 1878 to 1891, in the sum-total of 582,000,000 francs  exhausted  on school  constructions,  they  augmented  312,000,000 francs.--If certain parents are not  delighted  with this  procedure  they have only to subscribe  amid  themselves,  manufacture  a  confidential  school at their own  expenditure,  and support Christian Brothers or Sisters in these as teachers. That is their affair; they will not  compensate  one cent less to the commune, to the department or to the State, so that their  duty  will be  two times  and they will  compensate   double,  first for the  main   command  which they  disfavour,  and next for the  main   command  which  fits  them.--Thousands of  confidential  schools are  grounded  on these conditions. In 1887,[63104] these had 1,091,810  scholars,  about one fifth of all  offspring  inscribed in all the  main  schools. Thus one fifth of the parents  perform  not  like  the secular  procedure  for their children;  a  least,   they  have a  favourite   the other when the other is  proposed  to them; but, to offer it to them, very large donations, a multitude of voluntary subscriptions, are necessary. The distrust and aversion which this  procedure,   inflicted  from  atop   rouses  can be  evaluated  by the number of parents and  offspring  and by the  immensity  of the donations and subscriptions. Note,  additionally,  that in  more  of the other communes, in all  positions  where the  supplies,  the  universal   appreciating  and the generosity of  separate  someone   founders and donators are not  enough,  the parents, even distrustful and hostile, are now  forced  to  convey  their  offspring  to the school which is repugnant to them.--In  rank  to be more  exact,   suppose  an  agent  and  once a day   magazine   authorised  Secular  magazine,  obligatory and gratuitous for  offspring  from six to thirteen,  grounded  and  carried  by the State, at an  midpoint  cost of 582,000,000 francs to set it agoing, and 131,0000,000 francs of  per annum  expenditure, the  total  taken from the purses of taxpayers,  keenly  or not; take it for  given  that the 6,000,000  offspring,   female children  and  male offspring,  from six to thirteen, are  impelled  subscribers to this  magazine,  that they get it every day except Sundays, that, every day, they are  locked-in  to read the paper for six hours. The State, through toleration,  sanctions  the parents who  perform  not like the  agent  sheet to take another which  fits  them; but, that another may be  in   arrive at,  it is  needed  that  restricted  benefactors,  linked   concurrently  and  duty paid  by themselves, should be  keen  to  initiate  and support it;  then,  the  male parent  of a family is  forced  to read the secular  magazine  to his  offspring,  which he deems  horribly   written  and marred by superfluities and shortcomings, in  condensed   modified  in an objectionable spirit.
