At the same time, it is difficult to believe that serious dangers do not awai the Church if the unprotestantising influences that have spread within it continue to extend. It is not likely that the nation will conintue to give its support to the Church if that Church in its main tendencies cuts itself off from the Reformation. The conversiions to Catholicism in England, though probably much exaggerated, have been very numerous, and it is certainly not surprising that it should be so. If the Church of Rome permitted Protestantism to be constantly taught in her pulpits, and Protestant types of worship and character to be habitually held up to admiration, there can be little doubt that many of her worshippers would be shaken. If the Church of England becomes in general what it already is in some of its churches, it is not likely that English public opininon  will permanently acquiesce in it privilieged position in the State. If it ceases to be a Protestant Church, it will not long remain an established one, and its disestablishment would probably be followed by a disruption in which opinions would be more sharply defined, and the latitude of belief and the spirit of compromise that now characterise our English religious life might be seriously impaired.

CHAPTER XIII

THE MANAGEMENT OF CHARACTER

Of all the tasks which are set before man in life, the education and management of his character is the most important, and, in order that it should be successfully pursued, it is necessary that he should make a calm and careful survey of his own tendencies, unblinded either by the self deception which conceals errors and magnifies excellences, or by indiscriminate pessimism which refuses to recognise his powers for good.
