During our path of life; we will experience pain, loss, discouragements and defeats.  We cannot escape it, it is inevitable.  We may ask ourselves:  why, if God loves us, does he allow for such pain and misery?

Plants and animals have no knowledge of their demise.  They never consider to look forward to tomorrow.  They live life day by day, past and present is their only comfort.

But not man, he that constantly looks to the future.  During positive times looking to the future for hope, during the negative times, seeing death around every door.

Without this knowledge, life would be bliss. But that is what was given to us once we ate from the tree of knowledge .  "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."
