Now I am going to portray my story. The first thing I remember about me is that I've always abundant supply of time which I want to get rid off. I always have spent an hour wondering what I am going to do with this treasure. As a school boy I used to go out to any direction but at mature days I always have a naturalist taste like bird nesting.I also had a character of investigating every thing around me varying from catherine wheel to china closet this may enable me getting an award of F.R.S. My vigour and plunder of orchards laid the foundation of a first lord of the treasury.Even when I am at the Oxford university I have the abundant supply of this great gift. So I spend this gift on port drinking,flirtation, lounging, invention of new ties to cravats, and new tricks on proctors,billiards, boxing,and barmaids. Yet also time was abundant with me. 
               When I left university I had this blessing or debt with me.Then I tried to get away with this enemy with the strength , wit and wisdom of a million and a half me. But when I concentrated on bird nesting in Berkshire  I began this to defeat this invader.My other time passes are pigeon matches, coffee houses, bluestocking reunions,private quadrille practice,with public evening exhibitions of their fruits etc.At sundays Tattersal's, jockeying etc. I felt that sixty minutes in one hour is sixty hours itself.To get rid of this time I have done whatever possibility is there. I rushed to the streets tomeet the fellow sufferers.But with them my ailment increased rather than decreasing. One day to kill my enemy I went down to a great hotel of gamblers and this visit cost me my bachelor's house andone thousand pounds.This perplexed me a little. When one day I was wandering I met a fellow victim and he advised me  trot to new market.I took this prescription and it help me to get rid of an hour.
