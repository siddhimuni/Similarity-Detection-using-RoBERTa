When applied with oil or varnish, my improved luminous substance can be exposed to the weather
in the same manner as ordinary paint without suffering any diminution of its luminous property.
I claim as my invention the herein described luminous substance, consisting of calcined chalk,
sulphur, and bismuth, substantially as set forth.

Merrill B. Sherwood, Jr., of Buffalo, N. Y., obtained a patent for a phosphorescent composition,
dated August 9, 1881.

The author says: My invention relates to an improvement in phosphorescent illuminants.

I have taken advantage of the peculiar property which obtains in many bodies of absorbing light
during the day and emitting it during the night time.
