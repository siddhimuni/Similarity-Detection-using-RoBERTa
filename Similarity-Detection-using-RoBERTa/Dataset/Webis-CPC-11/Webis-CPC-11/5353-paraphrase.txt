This method has the advantage of equalizing the working of the engine throughout the journey, for when the load is greatest, with the full cage at the bottom and the whole length of rope out, the duty required in the first revolution of the engine is measured by the length of the smallest circumference; while the assistance derived from gravitating action



This plan, though mechanically a very good one, has certain defects, especially in the possibility of danger resulting from the rope slipping sideways, if A novelty in winding arrangements is the 
substitution of the electromotor for the steam engine, which has been effected in a few instances. In one of the best-known examples  the grooves in the bed are not perfectly true. 





 Motion is communicated to the rope by frictional contact with the drum, which is covered through about one-half of the circumference.







 each on the same shaft. Motion is obtained from a continuous-current generator driven by an alternating motor with a very heavy fly-wheel, a combination known as the Ilgner transformer, which runs continuously with a constant draught on the generating station
