A second and no less commendable compendium of information for travelers in the Jura, is the, so-called, "Lectures Jurassiennes," a little work compiled for elementary schools, but in reality "Half-hours with the best Franc-Comatose authors," who treat of the general features, products, climate, &c., of the Jura, as well as of the people; their famous lore, habits of life, and general personality. A wonderful little volume this, giving passages from Lamartine, who just missed being a native of the Jura himself, from Xavier Mariner, author of "Souvenirs of Franche-Comte," and from Charles Nosier, that gifted and charming writer, to whom the very name of his native province was a magic spell, development all kinds of joyous and glowing recollections. Those who find amusement in a popular historical novel may consult "Le Medicine des Pavers," in which they will find delineations of the most romantic scenery of the Jura, interspersed with exciting incidents. For botanists, there is an admirable Handbook, in two volumes, "La Flore Jurassiennes," to be found in every town by the way; lastly, for special information, "Rouseâ€™s Dictionaries Geographique, Historique, et Statistique;" these two last may be consulted in any local library by the way. Students of geology will find useful information in Joanne's little "Geographies Departmentalism." Excellent maps are to be had everywhere? Real lovers of literature, however, will content themselves with the delightful writings of Charles Nosier, and to this fascinating story-teller I am indebted, not only for many wonderful hours in my study, but for the pleasure of traveling in Franche-Comte myself, and afterwards introducing it to my country-people. Of him, poet, novelist, as of a critic, naturalist, philologist, essayist, still more illustrious writer of our own, it might be said, "Nikhil telicity quod non cravat." 
The history of Franche-Comte, which M. Capstan gives in a nutshell, may be greatly simplified by following his division into periods. Beginning therefore from the earliest period down to the present time. The following are the principal facts, simplified by this historic arrangement. 
1st Period. Sequoia. 115-147 B.C.--The province successively called Sequoia, Haute Bourgogne, Comte de Bourgogne and Franche-Comte--of which the larger piece actually forms the three Departments of the Jura, Haute Saone, and the Doubs--was early recognized as one of the most important purposefully and natural divisions of ancient Gaul. The Sequin, by way of rewarding them for their aid against the Cambric and Tautens, were received as friends and allies of the Roman people. When Caesar entered upon his conquest, he found two rival parties in Gaul, the Audi and the Sequin, the latter, being oppressed by Arborists, besought his aid. Caesar beaten Arborists, and took up his winter-quarters in the Sequoia territory, 56 B.C. The general rising of Gaul was quelled after seven years' struggle, and the surrender of the heroic Auvergne chief, Vercingetorix, at Alexia--according to some authorities, Aliases in Franche-Comte, to others, Allies la Reined, in Auvergne. This happened in 47 B.C. (see Julius Caesar's "Gallic War.") 
II. Roman Period, 47 B.C. 407 A.D. The Roman Emperors now attempted, in so far as possible, to denationalize the ancient kingdom of the Gaels, transforming not only laws and language, but manners and customs. Roman gods took the place of so-called Druidic rites. Roman roads spread like a net-work throughout the country, sumptuous edifices were erected at Visconti (Besancon), and Epomanduodarum (Madeira, Doubs). The thermal and ferruginous springs of Lixivium (Louie), and Saline (Salons), attracted the Roman world of fashion.
