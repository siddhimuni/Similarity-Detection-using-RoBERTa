Inventors regularly hit upon new thoughts or upon novel procedure by chance, but for every such option discovery, there are scores and perhaps hundreds of thoughts and devices that have been watchfully calculated, worked over, discarded, revised, customized, until they created the preferred results. There is a margin of chance in all research, but surrounding it there is a enormous field of vigilant idea and scheduling and of everlasting focused effort.
These explanations are commonplaces in the laboratory and in the department of research. They have filtered through to thinking people who begin to know the part that test plays in all forms of scientific progress. There is a wide-ranging agreement that if there is to be a boost in the knowledge that men acquire as regards the mechanical forces, the only sure way of gaining this knowledge is to weigh, measure, explain and categorize.
This applies to solids, liquids, gases, rocks, plants, animals, and even to the structure and function of the human body. But when it comes to societal institutions, even the wisest hesitate and query. 
Is it feasible that social knowledge can be obtained only in this way?
There is no further way! Like the individuals of which it is self-possessed, society must inspect, research, and gain knowledge of through trial and fault. In fact, that is the tacitly conventional system by which social knowledge is accumulated. History is a proof of social experiments--not so intentionally directed nor so watchfully designed as the experiments that are taking place in the chemical laboratory, but experiments none the fewer. What further explanation can account for the several forms of family relationship, the many varieties of holy organizations, the several types of political institutions, the huge amount of educational institutions?
