(1 Sam.
xx: 3; 1 Kings i: 29.) An appeal to God, whether direct or indirect, in attestation of the
truth of a declaration or promise, is an oath. As we have already said, a secret association
may exist without an oath. But we are not sure that any does. Odd-fellows have declared that
they have no initiatory oath. In the address published by the Grand Lodge of the United States,
referred to before, the following declaration is made: "No oath, as was once supposed, is administered
to the candidate." (App. to Proceedings of Grand Lodge, 1859, p. 10.) Yet Grosch, in his Odd-fellows'
Manual, speaks of an "appeal to heaven" in the initiation, at least, into one of the degrees.
