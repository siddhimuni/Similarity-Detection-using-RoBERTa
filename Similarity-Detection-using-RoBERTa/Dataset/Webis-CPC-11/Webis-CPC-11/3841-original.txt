It seemed to me that there were a hundred
people in the room, and that half the eyes which met mine were women's, Though I was not altogether
a stranger to such state as the Prince of Conde had maintained, this crowded anteroom filled
me with surprise, and even with a degree of awe, of which I was the next moment ashamed. True,
the flutter of silk and gleam of jewels surpassed anything I had then seen, for my fortunes
had never led me to the king's Court; but an instant's reflection reminded me that my fathers
had held their own in such scenes, and with a bow regulated rather by this thought than by
the shabbiness of my dress, I advanced amid a sudden silence.

'M. de Marsac!' the page announced, in a tone which sounded a little odd in my ears; so much
so, that I turned quickly to look at him. He was gone, however, and when I turned again the
eyes which met mine were full of smiles. A young girl who stood near me tittered. Put out of
countenance by this, I looked round in embarrassment to find someone to whom I might apply.

The room was long and narrow, panelled in chestnut, with a row of windows on the one hand,
and two fireplaces, now heaped with glowing logs, on the other. Between the fireplaces stood
a rack of arms. Round the nearer hearth lounged a group of pages, the exact counterparts of
the young blade who had brought me hither; and talking with these were as many young gentlewomen.
Two great hounds lay basking in the heat, and coiled between them, with her head on the back
of the larger, was a figure so strange that at another time I should have doubted my eyes.
It wore the fool's motley and cap and bells, but a second glance showed me the features were
a woman's. A torrent of black hair flowed loose about her neck, her eyes shone with wild merriment,
and her face, keen, thin, and hectic, glared at me from the dog's back.
