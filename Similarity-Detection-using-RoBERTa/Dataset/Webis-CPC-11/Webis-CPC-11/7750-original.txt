The proportion of capital to column in quantity of surface was very slight. The proportion
of voussoirs to arches naturally depended upon the size of the arch,--large voussoirs to large
arches, small voussoirs to small arches. Columns were only grouped around piers and on either
side of openings; and lastly, the natural development of the column in Romanesque work was
toward attenuation,--the later and the better the work, the more slender became the columns,
until at last they were merged into the Gothic multiple-columned piers. The carving upon the
arch-mouldings is, to a great extent, geometric, consisting of numerous facets cut in the stone,
lozenges, etc.; the so-called dogtooth moulding is a very favorite form of decoration. All
these carved mouldings were picked out in color, usually in red and green. The acanthus in
the Romanesque has lost much of its vigor, is flat, heavy-tipped, round-edged, and scratched
with V-cuts, and the vine is the leaf preferred by designers. Frequently masses of wall are
cut in geometric diaper patterns, also touched with color. Borders are not broad; and circular
forms, except in the arches, are seldom used. Romanesque was a barbaric art at the best, and
has the usual virtue of the barbarian,--a directness of attack at the problem in hand and a
simplicity in treating it which is invigorating to see.

WINDOWS IN THE CHURCH OF S. TERESIA, TRANI, ITALY.

These two windows have very little to suggest Byzantine influence in their design.
