Wednesday, March 14

Rain. We have been informed that the route to the next station is flooded, so here is where we will stay. The dealer who sold us his mules would probably jump at the opportunity to charge for the delay, but he himself contracted with us to deliver our bags to our meeting place at Teniet.

Hunting after breakfast, during which I took the time to survey the forest which surrounds our encampment and shot several brace of woodcocks and other small birds. I noticed that the Arabs had shot a porcupine and left the poor thing behind to bleed, while taking the wild boars with them.

When I returned to camp I discovered the Arabs disemboweling the boar. They threw the less delectable portion of its innards carelessly into the yard, and a fearsome group of jackals soon descended upon them. I made an attempt to ward off the lot, but unfortunately darkness has soon arrived and I was unable to get a good shot at them.

The rain continued throughout the night, flooding the river and rendering travel quite impossible. Sometime before breakfast I decided to walk down the road to a nearby Arab village and talk with them about their boar hunting techniques. My presence, along with gunpowder I had brought along for bargaining, caused quite a commotion in their community. They told me to come back after breakfast and they would show me a boar. I returned to camp, and headed back with a friend. Together with the locals we climbed a hill that was almost too steep for me, in search of a boar to hunt. I promised my guides money for tobacco. B. and I split ways with two groups of Arab hunters; eventually, hearing his gun go off, I hurried to his location to find that B. and his Arab had discovered a boar, but it had run off. As the evening was fast approaching we decided to return to camp and supper. We met and entertained a local captain at the camp, who promised us a guide. His English was quite good.
