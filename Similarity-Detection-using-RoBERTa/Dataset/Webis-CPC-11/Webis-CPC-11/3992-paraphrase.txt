Summit Graveniere Puy, a long round-backed hill, also near Clermont, consist almost entirely of a pile of volcanic ash, which removed all traces of a crater, but two lava flows appear to have flowed the sides of the mountain. Puy de DÃ´me, and mountains in its vicinity, also appear to be of volcanic origin, and were upheaved somewhat the same way as Jorullo. Although the appearance of the mountains of Auvergne, as clearly indicated they were active as the country around it acquired the present general conformation, no history nor tradition has preserved any record of their eruption.

There are existing, however, a letter from Sidonius Apollinaris, a cotemporary of Pliny, addressed to the bishop of Vienne, where he refers to forms of prayer, who were appointed by the bishop when the earthquake demolished the walls of Vienne, and mountains, opening far torrents threw flammable material. It seems therefore gone volcanoes in the neighborhood of Vienna, and perhaps those of Le Puy, was in a state of eruption not long after the early Christian era. West of the city behind, there is a small number of volcanic craters, of which two are the biggest crater lake Bouchet and Bar, which also seems to have been at one time a lake, but is now dry . The former has a diameter greater than about 2300 meters with a depth of about 90 meters. The latter is on top of a mountain, which is composed entirely of such substances as ejected by volcanoes. Its diameter is about 1660, and the depth was about 130 meters, while it is almost perfect in shape. Mountains near Vienne presents lava flows, which accommodate the existing valleys. Near Agde, also overlooking the Gulf of lions, on top of a hill called St. Loup, there is an extinct crater, where lava flows have dropped two apparently recent origin.
