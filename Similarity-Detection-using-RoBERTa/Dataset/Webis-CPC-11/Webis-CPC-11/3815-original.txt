D체speptos.--There's no oats about these; an' ef there was, 't wouldn't hurt ye none. It's jest
the kernel an' the shell mixed up together.

Eupeptos.--Dangerous combination. I have no military ambition,--wouldn't give a rush for a
spread eagle,--don't like the braying by a mortar.

D체speptos.--Wal, I mout as wal vamose, 's long as I've hove in my rations. Already gone risin'
a good half-ounce above my or'nary 'lowance. 'T wun't do to dissipate, even ef a feller a'n't
to hum an' nobody's the wiser. Natur' allers makes ye foot the bill all the same on sea an' shore.

Eupeptos. (Trolling in a low voice the celebrated barcarole,

    "My bark is by the shore," etc.)--

Stay, oh, stay, gentle stranger! See yon sausage fatly floating! Be not dogged to go, but come!
Prithee, return once more to the festive board! Lo! this--the fattest of the flock--shall be
thy portion, most favored Benjamin!

D체speptos. (--Muttering in the distance.)--That feller's a ra채l jo-fired numbskull. He don't
know any more about the fust principles o' human natur' than the babe unborn. Reg'lar goney.
Dunno whether he's jokin' or in sober airnest. Good mind to sail into him anyhow. Guess 't
'll do, though, to leave him to Natur'. He'll stuff himself to death fast enough ... pitchin'
into p'is'n ... sexton ... six-board box ... coroner's verdick ... run over by a fry ... engineer
did his dooty....

IX.--FINALE (con motivo.)

But time would fail me to tell you of the myriad golden spangles so thickly stitched into the
hurrying web of those fustian hours. Oh! that dim crepuscular time, when, with toe set to toe
squarely on the scratch, we stood up to one another, with eyes glaring through the gloaming,
and gave and took manfully, fighting out anew the old battles of the Bourbon vs. China, of
King James vs. Virginia, of Graham vs. Greece!
