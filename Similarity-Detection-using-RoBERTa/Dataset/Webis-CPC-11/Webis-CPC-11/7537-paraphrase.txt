Monday March 23-  Lohengrin.  The house was packed to hear siblings John and Melba. A sickly and distressed young boy whispered, "Please, sir, Mr. Johnnie DeRisky isn't here."

Sir Augustus did not move nor seemed moved by the young boy's plea.  However, he was panicking inside, knowing that he would have to act the part himself if nobody showed up.  The orchestra would be playing Wagner as planned.

Just then, Monsieur van Dyck entered casually, assessing how things were going without him.  With a clear voice, van Dyck announced that his throat was a little hoarse.  Pleasantly surprised, Sir Drury cried "Nonsense!"  A 'van Dyck' can ever be a little hoarse. You've come in the nick of time."  Jokingly, and not lost on van Dyck, Sir Drury chuckled "quite a devil's dyke, Mr. Dyck."  The revered opera singer laughed heartily. Drury continued, "You will astonish everyone tonight as Lohegrin."

van Dyck was surprised, but ready to take the leap.  He changed into costume, practiced some voice exercises, and readied himself for the performance.

Sir Drury was waiting backstage, wondering aloud why the performers were not in place.  The young boy lamented quietly to Drury, "Sir, Madame Melba is not here either."

"Melba not here?" boomed Drury. "Who will play Elsa?"  Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, and in comes Madame Nordica, offering her services for the performance.  Relief apparent on his face, Drury exclaimed, "The show is saved. WE are saved! The show will go on."

Madame Nordica and van Dyck could not have performed more perfectly than if they were already cast in the starring roles.  The crowds gave a standing ovation that wouldn't quit, requests for encores were abounding, and Drury knew the crowds would come back again and again.
