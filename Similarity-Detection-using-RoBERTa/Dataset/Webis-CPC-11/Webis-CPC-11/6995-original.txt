 Achilles and the Tortoise (Vol. ii., p. l54.).--[Greek: Idiôtês] will find the paradox of "Achilles and the Tortoise" explained by Mr. Mansel of St. John's College, Oxon, in a note to his late edition of Aldrich's Logic (1849, p. 125.). 

 He there shows that the fallacy is a material one: being a false assumption of the major premise, viz., that the sum of an infinite series is itself always infinite (whereas it may be finite). 

 Mansel refers to Plato, Parmenid. p. 128. [when will editors learn to specify the editions which they use?] Aristot.

 T.E.L.L. Stepony Ale (Vol. ii., p. 267.).--The extract from Chamberlayne certainly refers to ale brewed at Stepney. 

 In Playford's curious collection of old popular tunes, the English Dancing Master, 1721, is one called "Stepney Ale and Cakes;" and in the works of Tom Brown and Ned Ward, other allusions to the same are to be found. 

 EDWARD F. RIMBAULT. If they ever coined any, it is almost impossible that it should all have disappeared.

 Wormwood (Vol. ii., pp. 249. 315.).--The French gourmands have two sorts of liqueur flavoured with wormwood; Crême d'Absinthe, and Vermouthe. In the Almanac des Gourmands there is a pretty account of the latter, called the coup d'après. In the south of France, I think, they say it is the fashion to have a glass brought in towards the end of the repast by girls to refit the stomach.
