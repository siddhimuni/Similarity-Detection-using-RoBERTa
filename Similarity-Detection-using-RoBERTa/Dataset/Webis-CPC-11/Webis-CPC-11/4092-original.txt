Bokhara and Khiva, though represented as vassal khanates, are in reality mere dependencies
of Russia. An approximately settled frontier-line begins only farther east, where the Russian
and Chinese empires meet on the borders of eastern Turkestan, Mongolia and Manchuria.

Russia has no oceanic possessions, and has abandoned those she owned in the last century; her
islands are mere appendages of the mainland to which they belong. Such are the Aland archipelago,
Hochland, Tütters, Dagö and Osel in the Baltic Sea; Nova Zembla, with Kolgueff and Vaigatch,
in the Barents Sea; the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea; the New Siberian archipelago and
the small group of the Medvyezhii Islands off the Siberian coast; the Commandor Islands off
Kamchatka; the Shantar Islands and Saghalin in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Aleutian archipelago
was sold to the United States in 1867, together with Alaska, and in 1874 the Kurile Islands
were ceded to Japan.

A vast variety of physical features is obviously to be expected in a territory like this, which
comprises on the one side the cotton and silk regions of Turkestan and Trans-caucasia, and
on the other the moss and lichen-clothed Arctic tundras and the Verkhoyansk Siberian pole of
cold--the dry Transcaspian deserts and the regions watered by the monsoons on the coasts of
the Sea of Japan. Still, if the border regions, that is, two narrow belts in the north and
south, be left out of account, a striking uniformity of physical feature prevails. High plateaus,
like those of Pamir (the "Roof of the World") or of Armenia, and high mountain chains like
the snow-clad summits of the Caucasus, the Alay, the Thian-Shan, the Sayan, are met with only
on the outskirts of the empire.

Viewed broadly by the physical geographer, it appears as occupying the territories to the north-west
of that great plateau-belt of the old continent--the backbone of Asia--which spreads with decreasing
height and width from the high table-land of Tibet and Pamir to the lower plateaus of Mongolia,
and thence north-eastwards through the Vitim region to the furthest extremity of Asia.
