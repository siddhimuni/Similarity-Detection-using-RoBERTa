The balloon came from sailing, seeming to grow more and more closer he approached. Within car sat Corianda fairy. Is slowly lowered into the palace, and while it is based on fairy ground out, then re-suit and floated on air.

"Well, now! What happens to you all?" Fairy said, walking among children and comforting those affected. "Why are all so sad and unhappy you tired of being in this island enough? And really want to go back to Noviland?"

"Yes, yes, please take us home again," cried all. "I was very happy here, but now we want to go home to our dear Mammas and Papas Please do not take us home."

"Very well," said the fairy, "as you wish it will be all your own old houses back to tomorrow morning. Offer So goodbye Island children, and do not cry."

Then the fairy waved her hand, and immediately a silver mist surrounded their palace and houses have become quite less and less distinct, until it was only a vague and shadowy outline of them, then grew thick fog, and each child was alarmed to find themselves separated from all companions, and striving to shout, but could not. Grew thicker and thicker fog until it was quite dark, and children, separated from each other, were confused and did not know where they were.

Currently mist gradually removed, and then, instead of Island children and pretty houses, each child was in his own bed at Noviland.

Forward that morning they told their parents and child-loving good fairy island, the palace houses nice and pretty, young musicians, fairy slipper, and strange nomenclature. And as each language its pretty little story prattled parents smiled and said to each other, "our dear child truly had a pleasant dream!"

But the children knew better, knew there was a good fairy Corianda, and that she went to her magical island called Island Baby.
