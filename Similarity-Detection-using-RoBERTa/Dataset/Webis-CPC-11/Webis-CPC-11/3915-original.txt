The chance being offered to duplicate, at the Testing Station, the conditions represented in
a mine in the presence of gas, they showed an eagerness to modify and improve their explosives
so as to enable them to answer severe mining conditions, which is most commendable to American
industry.

In regard to the unfavorable conditions existing in mines in the past, the same arguments may
be used. In spite of the frequency of mine accidents in the United States, and in spite of
the high death rate in coal mining as compared with that in other countries, it must be said
in fairness that this has been the result of ignorance of the actual conditions which produce
mine explosions, rather than any willful disregard of the known laws of safety by mine owners.
Conditions in American mines are far different from those obtaining in mines abroad, and, as
a result, the rules which years of experience had taught to foreign colliery managers were
not quickly applied to conditions existing in American mines; but, as soon as the work at the
Pittsburg Station had demonstrated the explosibility of the coal dust from adjoining mines,
and had shown the very great safety of some explosives as compared with others, there was at
once a readiness on the part of mine owners throughout the country to improve conditions in
their mines, and to take advantage of all the studies made by the Government, thus showing
clearly that the disasters of the past had been due to lack of sufficient information rather
that to any willful disregard of the value of human lives.

Another of the indirect benefits of the work of the Station has resulted from its examination
of explosives for the Panama Canal. For several years the Isthmian Canal Commission has been
one of the largest users of explosives in the world, and, in the purchase of the enormous quantities
required, it was found necessary to establish a system of careful examination and inspection.
