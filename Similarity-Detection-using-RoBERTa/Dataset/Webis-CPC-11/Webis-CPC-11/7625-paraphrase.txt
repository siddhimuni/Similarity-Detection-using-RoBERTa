On 9 August 1881, Merrill B. Sherwood, Jr., from Buffalo, N. Y., received a patent for a new phosphorescent compound that could be applied like a glowing paint.

According to the author, the invention improved upon existing phosphorescent chemicals by expressing a quality that allowed the chemical to absorb daylight and glow in the dark.

The enhanced type of luminescent material was able to withstand weather conditions like regular paint, when affixed with a varnish or oil, without losing its luminescence.
