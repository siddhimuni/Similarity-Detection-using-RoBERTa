RITA (from within): Well?

What's the thing?

BERTHA (at the door): Oh, this gentleman here--he wants to see you very much. He is going through here.

RITA (within; laughs): Come in.

(Bertha disappears.)

(Friedrich has strolled up to the middle door, where he remains standing.)

RITA: Well. Who is it? Friedrich---- Hmm---- I shall come at once.

BERTHA (comes out and looks at Friedrich in shock): My lady wants you to await her. (She strolls away, after having taken another look at Friedrich.)

(Friedrich sees about embarrassed and shyly.)

(Rita gets in clothed in a tasteful dressing gown, but stays standing in the door.)

FRIEDRICH (bows; softly): Good day.

(Rita sees him with an ironical smile and stays silent.)

FRIEDRICH: You remember me?
