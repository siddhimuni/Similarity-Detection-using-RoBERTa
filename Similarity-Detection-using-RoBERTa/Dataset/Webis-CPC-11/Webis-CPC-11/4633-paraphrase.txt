I always get the best specimens of apples from the top-worked trees in Milwaukee.  It convinced me that you could grow better fruit that way.

Mr. Brackett: what age do you commence the grafting?

Mr. Philips: I like to graft at two years.  For Virginia crab, I let it grow one year and then commence top-working, top-working the first half year and balance the second.

Mr. Brackett: Is this in a nursery row?

Mr. Philips:  I have found the Virginia(and the Hibernal), where I have to grow, are very vigorous trees, The Virginia especially.  Of the forty varieties I have top worked, all Virginia's have a great mass of roots; they have strength, and grow fast.  Prof. Green, Mr Cady, and Mr Kellogg have been there numerous times, and I always ask then this question: If they found any trees where the top had outgrown the stock?  I have never seen an instance where the top of the tree put into a Virginia crab outgrew the Virginia.

Mr. Brackett: If your Virginia trees were 12 years old, would you top work them?

Mr. Philips: Yes, out to the end of the limbs.

Mr. Brackett: Suppose your limbs were too big on the stock, what would you do then?

Mr. Philips: I practice cutting larger limbs and letting young shoots grow.  Mr Dartt did a good deal of top work, mostly on large limbs.  I told him he was a fool, but he did not agree.  He inserted four scions, and where i have only put one in a Virginia limb about 3/4in in diameter, and had eight feet of growth.

The reason my attention was called to the Virgina as being vigorous was from attending the meeting of this society about thirty years ago, in Rochester, Mr A. W. Sias, who was an active nurseyman, offered a premium of $5.00 for the best growth of a crab apple tree.  In order to win the money himself, he brought in some limbs of a Virginia that were six feet long that grew in one season, and I figured that a tree could make that growth in one season was a vigorous tree.
