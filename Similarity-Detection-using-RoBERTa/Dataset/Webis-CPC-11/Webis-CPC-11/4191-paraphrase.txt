The water level had already risen to seven feet in the vessel.  The wind blowing form the west was driving the vessel towards the vast sea,  and the ship being old, was forced most damagingly.

On 18th morning Canada was out of sight, she was forced with  maximum speed for England.  The Ramillies had opened their frame at night, and under the admirals directions, by constant pressure on the protesting officers, and in spite of their strong lack of willingness to let off six of their most advanced and four of the aftermost guns off their main-deck were thrown along with that remaining on the quarter-deck, the ship was still not under control, so ordered to nail tarred canvas and hides in and towards both ends from under the sills of the ports on the main-deck under the fifth plank above, or through water-ways, and on the lower deck the crew did without orders the same procedure. Based on more complaints, more was required to be done, the  admiral all the guns on the upper deck and the lower deck to be shot and a range of heavy stores overboard. Presence of the leak in the grand magazine caused a water level of eight feet inside that almost filled the ship forward, therefore all the gentlemen onboard was bound to take a turn on the whips or in handing of the buckets. Besides from the fore-mast to the  main mast, the ship was frapped.

Even with the paramount efforts made, the water still advanced on them the following night, with heavy winds, an intense storm, a part of the orlop failed and fell into the hold, thus settling the ship itself forward.

On 19th morning, the admiral commanded to cut both the bower anchors, throw overboard all the junk including one sheet and one bower cable along with the residual cumbersome store that got in hand, and all the damaged powder in the grand magazine, the cutter and pinnace to be wrecked and tossed overboard, the skids having worked off the side; every life on board was taken up in bailing.
