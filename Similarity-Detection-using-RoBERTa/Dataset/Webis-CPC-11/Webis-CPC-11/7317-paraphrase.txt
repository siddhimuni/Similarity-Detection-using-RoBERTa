It should be capital fun, that it would. Suppose you have to give them to the young Bennetts; I told them the other day I will beg some of your old toys for them. It will be such a pleasure, I am sure, to make them a present. Poor children, you know, have seldom anything of the kind." 

"How you talk!" 

"How I talk!" continued William, "to be sure; besides, I hate waste, and it is just as much waste to shut things up which may be of use, as it should be to burn them; more, I think, for if they make firewood, that is proving of some use. 

Now don't be such a miser, Charles, do turn them out." 

"I would not do such things!" exclaimed Charles, in an angry tone, "and as for your extravagance, it is quite shocking; I wonder what your thought is to become of you when you are a man." 

"I told you what I expect," replied William, throwing some apples from his pocket out of window to a poor child who was passing; "what I expect is, to had to work very hard for my living, and, as I am the eldest, I look upon it that I ought to do something for mamma, and the girls into the bargain. 

But for all that I hope I should never turn a miserly screw. Why, when God gives us health, food, clothing, and lodging, don't you think that hoarding and hoarding, instead of dispensing the blessings, and performing such acts of kindness as might be in our power to bestow, is like doubting God's goodness and mercy for the future?" 

"One should think you were preaching," said Charles, with a sneer. 

"Besides," continued William, after a slight pause, "it seems to me that nature is constantly repeating the lesson which Scripture teaches us. See how, year after year, the blades of wheat spring up, and the fruits of the earth ripen, as if to warn us that we should distribute the good things God provides us with, and wholly trust that he would continue to send us all things that are needful." 

"Pray you will find that in the sermon, also?" asked Charles. 

"Perhaps I do." 

"can it say anything about the ten talents--where we are told that into every one that hath should be given, but from him that hath not should be taken away even that which he hath?" replied Charles, with an air of triumph. 

"Do you understand the text you have quoted?" asked William, mildly. 

"I suppose so, I am thyinking about it people think that to increase their stores than anything else." 

"Then let me tell you that you are quite wrong, for that is a text I used to hear papa explain very often, that it will be never applied to worldly possessions. 

But those who pray for, and seek by every means to acquire, heavenly grace would surely find it bestowed on them; while those who neglect to cultivate the spirit of religion would surely find any feelings of piety they may once have experienced in like manner depart from them. 

Every human being has the power, more or less, of doing good: and his means and opportunities are also among the 'talents' with which he is intrusted, and for which he must account at last." 

"Have you ever done preaching?" yawned the little miser. 

"Yes, for I am afraid you are beyond my teaching." 

And so the cousins parted. 

Charles sat musing for a little while. "How happy William seems!" thought he; "and yet I dare say at this moment he has not half-a-crown he can call his own. It is very fine of him, indeed, to talk of turning out the closet, he who had got nothing to keep." 

And so reasoned the selfish boy, amusing himself with gazing upon a shelf full of baby toys he could take no pleasure in using, but yet which he has not the heart to give away; and then he jingled a money-box, which was heavy enough to tell there is many, many coins inside, and yet he drew from his pocket a shilling, which he slipped through the narrow chink, thus adding to his useless store. 

Oh! sad it is to believe that no thought of gratitude to the Almighty for the blessings with which he was surrounded; no prayer for guidance from on high rose in his heart; no thought of the duty of cultivating the "talents" which had fallen to his share.
