He had worked for years on his invention, and although it was not perfected, he had come closer than anyone else to solving the problems that kept it from being produced commercially.
He was ready to obtain a patent on his work, but his money was all gone, and he had a family to support.
He then began the work of finding investors. He visited everyone he could think-of, and finally he was introduced to Mr. J with the T&B company.
Mr. J had faith in the invention and agreed to subsidize his work. It has still not perfected, and it has not been released to the public yet, but over the years it has been improved, and although not a penny has been made from it, the inventor and his family live in comfort and security thanks to the generosity of the investor who is also interested in the problem to be solved by the invention.

The Impractical Man

Sydney Williams wonders why his life is a failure. He comes from a line of Preachers, and is the youngest of eleven children. He traces his lineage back to plantation days, and recalls that his forefathers were known as having been slave-holders who freed their slaves as soon as it became practical.
He remembers living at a girls school in his formative years, as the child of the President.
His family values education, and strives to preserve Christian values, as they have through the generations.
His Grandfather was a carpenter until an illness took-away his strength and left him an invalid.
Hard work and determination is what he knows best.
