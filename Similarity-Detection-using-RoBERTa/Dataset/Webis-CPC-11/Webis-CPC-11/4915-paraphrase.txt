Without the faintest dream of remuneration, no one will move hand or tongue. The weaver is always an ambitious character. Our theory is that the motive is Philanthropy, and nothing else, as not satisfied and being greedy for the entire life.

She is original and unique only in the length to which she carries a common principle in human nature. 


Society is full of advisers on a small scale. Ask your way to a place in the street, the Mentor you invoke is instantaneously seized with a strong desire. He calls after you a supplement to his directions; and if you chance to turn your head, you will observe him watching whether you do take his advise. When the opinions of two advisers, no matter on what subject, clash, mark the heat and obstinacy with which they are defended. Each considers himself in the right, believing your wellbeing to depend upon the choice you make, is humanely solicitous that you should give the preference to him. The managing partner merely carries out this feeling to a noble, and becomes the philanthropist par excellence. Philanthropy is virtue, is its own reward--that is, we all say; for in reality the idea is not true. Perhaps being virtuous which rewards the act of virtue, and how happy must the managing partner be! Troubled by no vulgar ambition, by no hankering after notoriety, by no yearning to join ostensibly in the game of life, she shrouds herself in obscurity, as the widow Bessie Maclure in Old Mortality did in an old red cloak, and directs with a whisper the way of the passer-by. There is a certain awful pride, at times in that woman's bosom, as she thinks of the events which her counsel is now governing, and of the wheels that are now turning and twirling in obedience to the impulse they received from her! 


The managing partner manages a great many benevolent societies, but it is unnecessary here to mention more than one. This is the Advice-to-the-poor-and-needy-giving Ladies' Samaritan Association.
