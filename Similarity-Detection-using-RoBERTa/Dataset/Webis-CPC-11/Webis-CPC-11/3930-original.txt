The immortal debates of Lincoln and Douglas in 1858 were never put into
a book until 1860, existing previously only in newspaper print. Newspapers are sometimes important
in fixing a date and in establishing the whereabouts of a man. If, for example, a writer draws
a fruitful inference from the alleged fact that President Lincoln went to see Edwin Booth play
Hamlet in Washington in February, 1863, and if one finds by a consultation of the newspaper
theatrical advertisements that Edwin Booth did not visit Washington during that month, the
significance of the inference is destroyed. Lincoln paid General Scott a memorable visit at
West Point in June, 1862. You may, if I remember correctly, search the books in vain to get
at the exact date of this visit; but turn to the newspaper files and you find that the President
left Washington at such an hour on such a day, arrived at Jersey City at a stated time, and
made the transfer to the other railroad which took him to the station opposite West Point.
The time of his leaving West Point and the hour of his return to Washington are also given.

The value of newspapers as an indication of public sentiment is sometimes questioned, but it
can hardly be doubted that the average man will read the newspaper with the sentiments of which
he agrees. "I inquired about newspaper opinion," said Joseph Chamberlain in the House of Commons
last May. "I knew no other way of getting at popular opinion." During the years between 1854
and 1860 the daily journals were a pretty good reflection of public sentiment in the United
States. Wherever, for instance, you found the New York Weekly Tribune largely read, Republican
majorities were sure to be had when election day came. For fact and for opinion, if you knew
the contributors, statements and editorials by them were entitled to as much weight as similar
public expressions in any other form. You get to know Greeley and you learn to recognize his
style.
