Thou must take them one by one, and in their order, child, however sorely tempted
to break the sequence. Keep thine eye and thy labor for the nearest one, and at last the red-winged
goose itself will reward thy patience."

Mihal heard and treasured up the Dwarf-king's orders, spoke his simple thanks, bowing low,
and, after a gay farewell to the little old woman who had been his jackdaw, went his way into
the upper air; and just as the sun arose, touching the pine-tree tops with fire, he came to
his father's hut, where the eight children were rubbing their eyes and Zitza crying for her
breakfast. No one knew that Mihal had been farther than the door-sill, nor did he tell the
clamorous brood of children what he had seen, lest they should mock it as a dream, or attempt
the pursuit themselves.

So he went patiently about his work, helped them look for Meister Hans, whom all mourned for
many a day,--excepting Mihal, who well knew how much better off the jackdaw was than in any
of the pitiful conditions they fancied, and the parents, who were too thankful to gain even
the bird's small share of bread for their wasted and fretful children.

But after nightfall Mihal crept softly from his straw in the corner, tied a sheep-skin across
his shoulders, and, with his uneaten supper, a crust of black bread, in the bosom of his ragged
shirt, stole softly out of the door to seek his fortune. About two miles from the hut there
was a clear space in the pine forest, where there stood a great stone cross, at the foot of
which a tiny spring slept in the grass, and overflowed softly on the crisp turf at all seasons.
At this place Mihal resolved to wait for the flight of the red-winged goose, and he knew the
forest paths so well that a short half-hour brought him to the open glade. He knelt and bathed
his face in the spring, drank deeply of its pure and tranquil waters, and then leaned back
against the foot of the cross to eat his crust and wait till moon-rise.
