La Mina, 1834, old and bedridden, with his energies, mental and physical perhaps, affected by the long inaction, was a man very different from Mina in 1810. In fighting against the French, the sympathies of Navarre were with him, and now are against him, and in a war of this description, the difference was of immense importance. Despite the winter season and the wickedness of their health, one of the first things he did upon assuming command was to make an excursion to Puente la Reina, Mañeru, and other places where, in recent days, had had his headquarters general, and had then never entered without being greeted as a hero and patriot, and greeted with cheers enthusiasts. He flattered himself that this enthusiasm was awakened once again by his appearance, and was all the more surprised when he found himself greeted with extreme coldness and indifference. His illness was aggravated by disappointment, angry and upset and returned to Pamplona. From there, disabled by his infirmities to exercise the same in the field, he directed his cabinet to the operations of his lieutenants and issued orders, from the cruelty of some of which soon made his name is as detested in Navarre, which there was once revered. At any time of the war was less mercy to each other by the contending parties during the command of Mina. In addition to shoot all the prisoners taken with arms in hand, sent the injured to that found in hospitals to be Carlist dead in their beds, and strangled club or a knight of Pamplona, for any reason that might be discovered unless they had two children with the Carlist. Several strengths at this time are being taken or battered by Zumalacárregui, Mina decided to seize the guns with which they had done that. He was aware that the difficulty in obtaining Carlists had artillery, and knowing that it could be easily transported from place to place in rugged and mountainous country, he surmised that had the custom of burying him, that was really the case.
