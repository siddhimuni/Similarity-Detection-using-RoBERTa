Fort Regent stands on the big hill that overlooks the harbour and has a view of the whole bay, including Elizabeth Castle.  Lots of rocks have been blown from the cliff so that it is essentially unassailable.  The barracks can't be bombed because they are scooped in the ramparts.  The coffin-shaped parade ground is at the center of the fortifications.  The whole fortress had been made after the peace, and it was now under the watch of the twelfth regiment although it didn't seem as if they were preparing for war.  There's a beautiful accumulation of rocks and stones called the Violet Bank on the southeast corner of the island.  It's an undersea garden that will tell even the most nervous about Jersey's imperviousness to the "towers along the steep."

It may seem to a St. Helier outsider that he is in England, but he disabuses himself of that story as soon as he goes deeper into the countryside.  There are no big roads, just paths that are narrow and deeply sunk, surrounded by so many large hedges and trees that daylight is obscured.  You can barely see the fields from these roads, but they are indeed tiny paddocks of not more than a few acres.

The whole country seems to be like a forest because of these hedges and trees, and there are as many lanes and fences as there is farmland.

A Brief Story of An Idiot

Those who love dramatic history have probably heard of the contest between Garrick and Madam Clairon and the wonderful stage presentation made by the English Roscius when he played a father who's only child as an infant jumped for joy in his arms and was dashed to bits.  Is there any other avenue to explore in drama, other than the levels of idiocy that exist just below the surface of the mind?
