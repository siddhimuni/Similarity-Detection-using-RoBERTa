All that raving about school-boys is perfect nonsense--it is the most
miserable period of a human being's life. Poor, shivering, trembling, kicked, buffetted, thumped,
and starved little mortals! We never see a large school but we feel inclined to shoot them
all, masters, ushers, and door-keepers included, merely to put them out of pain.

But at College, how different!--There, a man begins to feel that it is a matter of total indifference
to him whether he sit on a hard wooden bench, or a soft stuffed chair; there, the short coat
is discarded, and he stalks about with the air of a three-tailed bashaw, as his own two, generally,
at first, are prolonged a little below the knee; there, his penny tart, which he bought on
Saturdays at the door of the school, is exchanged for a dessert from Golding's; his beer, which
he occasionally imbibed at the little pot-house, two miles beyond the school bounds, is exchanged
for his wine from Butler's.--Books from Talboy's, the most enterprising of bibliopoles, supply
the place of the tattered Dictionary he brought to the University, which, after being stolen
when new, and passing, by the same process, through twenty hands, is at last, when fluttering
in its last leaves, restolen by the original proprietor, who fancies he has made a very profitable
"nibble." The trot he used to enjoy by stealth on the butcher's broken-kneed pony, is succeeded
now by a gallop on a steed of Quartermain's; and he is delighted to find that horse and owner
strive which shall be the softest-mouthed and gentlest charger.
