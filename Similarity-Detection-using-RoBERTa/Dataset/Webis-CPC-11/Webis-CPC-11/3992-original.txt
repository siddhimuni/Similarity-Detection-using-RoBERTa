The summit of Puy Graveniere, a long round- backed hill also near Clermont,
consists almost entirely of a heap of volcanic cinders, which have obliterated all traces of
a crater; but two streams of lava appear to have flowed from the sides of the mountain. The
Puy de DÃ´me, and the mountains in its neighbourhood, likewise appear to be of volcanic origin,
and to have been upheaved somewhat in the same manner as Jorullo. Although the aspect of the
mountains of Auvergne indicates so clearly their having been active since the surrounding country
acquired its present general conformation, neither history nor tradition has preserved any
record of their eruptions.

There is extant, however, a letter from Sidonius Apollinaris, a cotemporary of Pliny, addressed
to the Bishop of Vienne, in which he refers to forms of prayer which had been appointed by
the bishop at the time when earthquakes demolished the walls of Vienne, and the mountains,
opening, vomited forth torrents of inflamed materials. It hence appears that the extinct volcanoes
in the neighbourhood of Vienne, and perhaps those of Le Puy, had been in a state of eruption
not long after the beginning of the Christian era. To the westward of the latter town, there
is a number of small volcanic craters, of which the two largest are the Lake de Bouchet and
the Crater of Bar, which also appears to have been at one time a lake, but is now dry. The
former has its greatest diameter about 2300 feet, with a depth of about 90 feet. The latter
is on the top of a mountain, which is composed entirely of such substances as are ejected by
volcanoes. Its diameter is about 1660, and its depth about 130 feet; while it is almost perfect
in its form. The mountains near Vienne exhibit streams of lava, which accommodate themselves
to the existing valleys. Near Agde also, on the shores of the Gulf of Lions, on the top of
a hill named St. Loup, there is an extinct crater, whence have descended two streams of lava
apparently of recent origin.
