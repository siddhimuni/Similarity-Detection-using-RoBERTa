CAPTAIN ROCK.

There are few of our readers who need to be informed that Captain Rock's Letters to the King
are certainly not written by Mr. Moore, to whom, while the publication was suspended, they
were so positively ascribed.--Q. Rev.

THE LIBRARY AT HOLKHAM.

The manuscripts of Lord Coke are in the possession of his descendant, Mr. Coke, of Norfolk,
his representative through the female issue of Lord Leicester, the male heir of the chief justice.
At this gentleman's princely mansion of Holkham, is one of the finest collections, or, indeed,
libraries of manuscripts anywhere preserved; certainly the finest in any private individual's
possession. It partly consists of the chief justice's papers; the rest, and the bulk of it,
was collected by that accomplished nobleman who built the mansion, the last male heir of the
great lawyer. He had spent many years abroad, where his taste was improved and his general
education perfected. He collected a vast number of the most valuable manuscripts. Of these
the exquisitely illuminated missals, and other writings of a similar description, which would
from their perfect beauty and great rarity bear the highest price in the market, are certainly
by far the least precious in the eyes of literary men. Many of the finest codices of the Greek,
Latin, and old Italian classics are to be found in this superb collection. Among others are
no less than thirteen of Livy, a favourite author of Lord Leicester, whom he had made some
progress in editing, when he learnt that Drakenborchius, the well known German critic, had
proceeded further in the same task, and generously handed over to him the treasures of his
library. The excellent edition of that commentator makes constant reference to the Holkham
manuscripts, under the name of MSS. Lovelliana, from the title of Lovell; Lord Leicester not
having then been promoted to the earldom.
