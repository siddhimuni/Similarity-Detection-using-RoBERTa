Aside from this, his work is a work of genius; and his story of the little girl who struggled with such vain endeavor against her environment will live among the noblest productions of fiction given us.
The Professor's Sister, by Julian Hawthorne (Belford, Clarke & Co). ---This is the most successful work of a successful novelist, and holds the reader entranced from the first page till nearly the last. We say reader, but not all readers. Mr. Hawthorne is as peculiar in his work as his eminent father was, with a more select audience. He is at home in the wild, weird production of humanity, touched and marked by a spiritualism that is far above and beyond the average readers of romance. If it calls for as much culture, in its way, to enjoy a work of art as its creation called for in the artist, Mr. Hawthorne's fictions demand the same tastes and thought the author indulges in. The little girl who craves love-stories, or the traveler upon the cars who picks up a book to lose in its pages the wearisome sense of travel, will scarcely select the Professor's Sister, and if he or she does, will wonder what in the name of Heaven it is all about.
