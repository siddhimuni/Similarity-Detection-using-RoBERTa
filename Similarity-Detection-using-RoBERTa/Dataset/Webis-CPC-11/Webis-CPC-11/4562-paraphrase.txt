They speak Arabic because of their contact with Egypt, but the south south-eastern portion of the tribe still speak Beja dialect.They won't speak this before strangers as they believe that his will bring ruin to them. Those who live near Nile  have much fellah blood. They claim to be Arab origin through their sheikhs. They dress like the fellahin unlike their  kinsmen the Busharin Hadendoa, who  go naked.The latter have fine physique but they are small with of an average height of 5ft or a little above except the Sheikh clan. Their complexion is rather red than black, with angular features, straight nose and a luxuriant hair. They are honest in money matters and hospitable. They have their own pride so that they wont beg. But they are trecherous and faithless.Ababda was poor before the British occupation in Egypt. They settles in Nubia, where their main livelihood is agriculture and fishing. Some live by charcol burning, wood-gathering and trading in gums and drugs (senna leaves). They live in small huts made with hurdles and mats and some even live in natural caves as their ancestors.
