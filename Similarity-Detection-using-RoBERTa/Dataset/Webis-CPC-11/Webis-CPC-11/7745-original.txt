"What?"

"The whiskey. You were quite faint and chilled, you know. We gave you some."

"Out of--that--black--bottle?"

"Yes."

Another silence.

"I'd like some coffee. I don't think he'd begrudge me that, if he did save my life."

"I dare say there's some left." Her father at once bestirred himself and presently brought
her some coffee in a tin cup. It was part of Miss Amy's rapid convalescence, or equally of
her debilitated condition, that she made no comment on the vessel. She lay for some moments
looking curiously around the cabin; she had no doubt it had a worse look in the daylight, but
somehow the firelight brought out a wondrous luxury of color in the bark floor and thatching.
Besides, it was not "smelly," as she feared it would be; on the contrary the spicy aroma of
the woods was always dominant. She remembered that it was this that always made a greasy, oily
picnic tolerable. She raised herself on her elbow, seeing which her father continued confidently,
"Perhaps, dear, if you sat up for a few moments you might be strong enough presently to walk
down with me to the wagon. It would save time."

Amy instantly lay down again. "I don't know what you can be thinking of, papa. After this shock
really I don't feel as if I could STAND alone, much less WALK. But, of course," with pathetic
resignation, "if you and Mr. Waterhouse supported me, perhaps I might crawl a few steps at a time."

"Nonsense, Amy. Of course, this man Tenbrook will carry you down as he brought you up. Only
I thought,--but there are steps, they're coming now. No!--only HE."

The sound of crackling in the underbrush was followed by a momentary darkening of the open
door of the cabin. It was the tall figure of the mountaineer.
