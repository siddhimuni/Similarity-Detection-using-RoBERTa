It could be an order or it could be blessing - But it made everything clear within seconds. The hand unfolded and the head raised. Alarmed, he took glance around. He looked scared, as if his humbleness had exposed something which should have been kept a secret. Then both the men took their ways in two different directions and disappeared.

Cleotos had been staring out of the window at the modest old man for quite some time, so was Ænone -Cleotos could make that she was equally observant.


Ænone asked Clentos if he knew that old man. "His name is Clemens"- Clentos replied. " He is a  prominant person and leader among the Christian sect. I first met him at Corinth . He allowed me to copy the good words. Two years has past since them. But his image is still as clear still now. I had no difficulty in recognizing him. But I am wondering why is he here? and why should he put his life at risk in public?"

Ænone said " give me that roll of parchment - I will keep it by myself"

Cleotos became suspicious. He stared at her. He was not sure if she was showing her authority and trying to take away something which was so dear to his heart and which he treasured so much - the few lines written on the parchment, though did not understand those very clearly.If she is being demanding he has no other option but to do as she wishes, but is she really like that, does not seem to be , looking at her past kind behavior. 

Ænone could read his mind. " This is not an order but a friendly request", she said. "When you are away, I will cherish the  good memories of the happy days. I may even want to use those beautiful word to satisfy my soul"
