Metals which either did not exhibit this property, or did so only a little, were exposed to pressures of approximatly 20,000 atmospheres.  He found that while the pressure peremently increased the metals the density at first, future applications of pressure did not not.

The metals density had reached its limit. This test showed that the density of solids is not greatly affected by pressure but by temperature, similar to liquids.  You cannot permenetly condense solid objects, but solid objects can assume an allotropic condition of increased density.  The authors previous findings indicate that matter in the solid state, with proper temperature, is likely to take the state matching the volume which it is forced to occupy.  So there is similiarity between different states of aggregation of matter and allotropic states of some solids.  This may be due to polymerization.  The critical moment when the solid matter begings to flow when subjected to pressure is the limit of its elasticity.  This is similar to when ice, at or below 0 degrees, can be turned to liquid with enough pressure.  If somthing cannot flow under pressure, then it is said to be a brittle body.

Even though hydrogen is a gas, it is recognized by most scientists as a metal.  When it is combined with a metal it will produce an alloy, which electrictians know as the polarization of a negative element.  In the case of hydrogen combined with the liquid mercury, it is known as a "hydrogen amalgam".

Specialists in the fields of chemistry and mining have labored for years for a practicle way to prevent this so-called "sickening" of mercury, which leads to "flouring" and makes it useless for commercial purposes.
