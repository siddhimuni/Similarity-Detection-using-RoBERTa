[221] "in reply to your telegram concerning your dream of entering manila after four hours of combat. I have the honour to inform you for myself and the officers and soldiers under my command that your dream will come true as soon as the conflict with the americans begins, since we shall advance at any cost."--p.I.R., 849.

[222] on january 21, 1899, the commander of the fourth zone, caloocan, wired aguinaldo that:

"julian santo, commander of the territorial militia of trozo, informs me that 400 native soldiers of the spanish army to-day incorporated in his militia. He lives in the walled city, and he wants to know your opinion upon the present situation, since the americans want to hold them as prisoners or confine them in bilibid prison."

(indorsed, handwriting of aguinaldo:) "tell the filipino soldiers in the walled city affiliated to our cause that they must keep on good terms with the americans, in order to deceive them, and prevent their confining them, since the hoped-for moment has not yet arrived."--p.I.R., 849.

[223] on january 20, 1899, a correspondent wrote to one of the insurgents abroad:

"in some places (in manila) there have been fights with bolos between filipinos and americans who wanted to tear down the proclamation of our president while the people defended it with their bolos. They say that it amuses them to see the americans run when they draw their knives. It is said that some 10,000 servants have gone on strike. Some americans have already disappeared by the method of 'dukut' but it will not be proper to publish this in my opinion."--p.I.R., 980. 82.
