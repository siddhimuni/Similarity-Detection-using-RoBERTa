She came upon it unexpectedly, and unnoticeably reclused from her pen and books and for many weeks took up a business from home untill she no longer physically or mentally have the will to continue. She began wasting away and could not hold in her wretched emotions of sadness. Since she distanced herself from people, her mother did not notice her troubles. "Lucretia, it is a long time since you have written any thing." Said her mother. With tears flowing she said, "O mother, I have given that up long ago." "But why?" said her mother. With strong reaction she replied "I am convinced from what my friends have said, and from what I see, that I have done wrong in pursuing the course I have. I well know the circumstances of the family are such, that it requires the united efforts of every member to sustain it; and since my eldest sister is now gone, it becomes my duty to do every thing in my power to lighten the cares of my parents." Seeing how distressed she was, her mother reacted in a comforting way. She told her daughter not to avoid any great decision to comform to either side of devoting to her ambitions, nor ignoring them. This made her mind at ease, because she could still write and be happy.

She was thirteen years old when her mother had coached her on this. Although it may not be clear in the passage how exactly this effected her mind set.

When I start to think about something deeply and am figuring it out, it unfortunately escapes me no matter how much I wish for the thoughts to be solved. I give up, defeated.

She pleads with me to write and when I attempt to do so she critisized my work and laughs at my failure and I am left helpless and unaccomplished.

My friends all bost that they have great accomplishmetns but I tell them to keep them to themselves so I seem less of a failure.

Lucrecia was not as ungifted as she is portrayed. She was just embound with an impossible task that she could not amount up to.
