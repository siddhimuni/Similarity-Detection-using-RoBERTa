The
sight is, therefore, compelled to leave the sensations where they are, and the apprehension
of them where it is; and to recognize the two as sundered from each other--the sensations as
separated from the organ, which they truly are. Thus it is that we would explain the origin
of the perception of distance by the eye; believing firmly that the sight would never have
discerned this distance without the mediation of the touch.

Rightly to understand the foregoing reasoning--indeed to advance a single step in the true
philosophy of sensation--we much divest ourselves of the prejudice instilled into us by a false
physiology, that what we call our organism, or, in plain words, our body, is necessarily the
seat of our sensations. That all our sensations come to be associated in some way with this
body, and that some of them even come to be associated with it in place, is undeniable; but
so far is it from being true, that they are all essentially implicated or incorporated with
it, and cannot exist at a distance from it, that we have a direct proof to the contrary in
our sensations of vision; and until the physiologist can prove (what has never yet been proven)
an à priori necessity that our sensations must be where our bodies are, and an à priori absurdity
in the contrary supposition, he must excuse us for resolutely standing by the fact as we find it.

This is a view which admits of much discussion, and we would gladly expatiate upon the subject,
did time and space permit; but we must content ourselves with winding up the present observations
with the accompanying diagram, which we think explains our view beyond the possibility of a
mistake.

Let A be the original synthesis, or indiscrimination of vision and its sensations--of light
and colours.
