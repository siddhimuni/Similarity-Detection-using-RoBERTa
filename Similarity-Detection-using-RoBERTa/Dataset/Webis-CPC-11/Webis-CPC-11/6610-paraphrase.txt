Anyone who makes a petition to our divine creator, be it directly through prayer or circuitously in speaking, must realize that the words spoken become a binding contract and cannot be broken (1Sa 20:3, 1Ki 1:29).  As stated earlier, any affiliations with a third party entity that are not formerly known or declared, may exist without a binding contract.  However, no evidence supports that such a third party entity even exists.  Members associated with certain unnamed organizations have already stated that they have not entered any previous binding contract.  As previously recorded, a formal decree published by the Grand Lodge of the United States asserts that: “No oath, as was once supposed, is administered to the candidate.”

Even so, Grosch to a certain extent speaks of an “appeal to heaven” in the beginning of his Odd-fellows’ Manual. (Proceedings of Grand Lodge of United States, 1859, Ap., p. 10.)
