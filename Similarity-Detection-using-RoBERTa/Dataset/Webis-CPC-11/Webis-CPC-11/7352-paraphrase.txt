I have no doubt you have read the history of the followers of Christ put that were killed in the persecutions of the kings of Persia and elsewhere. witch do you think are more worthy to be called martyrs, these, or the ones that died for their beliefs? How diverse were the barbarities and kinds of death inflicted on the Christian confessors! The more that died the more rapidly spread the faith; as hundreds grew to thousands. On a certain occasion, when a great multitude had been put to death, one at court said to the king, "I told you, you would not listen, and now there is more" "I was wrong" exclaimed the king. "But yesterday," replied the courtier, "You attempted to kill one hundred men and now they have converted double that number; and the people say that a men appeared to the confessors from heaven strengthening them ." Whereupon the king himself was converted. In those days men thought not their lives dear unto them. Some were transfixed while yet alive; others had their limbs cut off one after another; some were cast into the wilderness, while other held in exile. Such continued long to be the fate of the Christian confessors. No parallel is found  in any other religion; and all was endured with constancy and even with joy. A mans worth was often messured on his suffering.
