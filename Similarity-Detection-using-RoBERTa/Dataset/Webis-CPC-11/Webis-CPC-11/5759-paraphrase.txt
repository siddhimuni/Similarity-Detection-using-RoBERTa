So much for family history. My Lord Chancellor King was close friend or relative, but it has slipped my mind if his mother was a Keen or Lock. I had received this data from my Aunt. Her name was Darby. He did not have a great personality, but he was good mannered, a gentleman.

Miss Strickland quotes in her first volume that the the Earl of Essex was related to the royal family, being that he indeed was the nephew of the Duke of York, but was not related by blood to Jane Mortimer. Miss Strickland though states that she may be using the name Jane for Anne, being that she does not have the book to look at right there. The author of this paragraph is pondering though as to where Miss Strickland finds that the Earl Of Cambridge had a second marriage. 

The Author wonders if the Highland Military wore both a dagger plus a sword with a broad, flat, blade. Maybe also their military drills were different to the other troop's drills. He has heard that the military #28 had swords called "Slashers". The author wonders if this is indeed the name of the swords. Is it? and if not, what is it? And what is the meaning behing the white shell jackets which they had worn?
