We often hear the saying "Ignorance is bliss."  But some authors add: "Skepticism is wisdom."

Quotations that support this idea are the following: 

* * * The Protestant oftentimes takes up his open Bible; he wishes to believe; he tries to believe. * * * All these efforts avail nothing." Christian Theology and Modern Skepticism, 1872, p. 144. 

"The Duke and the Protestant are simply trying to do two things at once; and, naturally, Professor Huxley is tempted in the same direction." Lay Sermons, p. 21. "But then he is keen enough to suspect some absurdity in the position, and honestly proclaims that the army of liberal thought is, at present, in very loose order; and many a spirited freethinker makes use of his freedom mainly to vent nonsense." Lay Sermons, p. 69. 

It is indeed tempting to wallow in a "paradise of illusions."  Even if a person gets frustrated because of the impossibility of his illusions, at least he has lived with joy and blessings.  In case there is no "hereafter," then the skeptic and the illusionist are placed in equal footing because there is nothing to look forward to after all.  But I shall not take sides.

Our maturity makes us happy people who will not get disappointed with illusions.  In the end, we will find out that what matters is not being able to prove ignorance or illusion.  What matters is that we lived a life of wisdom and lived.

Evolution. DEDICATED TO C.F., DANVILLE, IND. 

There has always been a great division between religion and science as to the subject of evolution.  

Scientists who reject religion think that they are too intelligent as compared to those who believe in the Bible, the supposed "uneducated fools."

Mr. Huxley asks theologians to let science alone.  In the same way, scientists should also let alone those who are believers in the Bible.
