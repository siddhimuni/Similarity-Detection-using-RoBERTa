I refer for instances to the Convention Act, the Insurrection Act, the Gunpowder Act, and the Press Bill, a evaluate which, in my inventory of the brutal steps taken by the Irish administration, escaped me, though perhaps it is, of all the frightful group, the most well-known and most lethal to emancipation and the constitution. The other cause on which my view rests is, because management have persevered in that system without building any one effort to alleviate displeasure or please the reasonable and faithful part of the society by the dispensation of any of those actions on which the spirit of the nation was fixed--because they have gone on in antagonism to the sense of the best men in the kingdom to force the citizens of Ireland, or the disgruntled part of it, into open and affirmed insurgence, rather than try any means to avert that upheaval by conciliating measures--because this purpose was stated and gloried in[2]--and, finally, because from the outset of their career they have resorted to military intimidation in every case where they could find, or create, the slightest pretence for the use of that appalling engine. 

The flare which by these resources has been kindled in Ireland can be extinguished but in one of two ways--either the rebels aided by the influence of France will thrive in wresting Ireland from the British association, or the military force with which the Irish government is entrusted will smother in blood the discontents of the nation. Of the first there is gladly no danger. The statistics of the insurgents is much too small to jeopardize the relation, and that judicious and loyal party, which organization have hitherto treated with scorn, is too strong and too much attached to the present form of government, in spite of what they had suffered, either to be prevail over the force, or seduce the pretense of estrangement, to sacrifice their adherence. There vestiges then only the other alternative--and of that what will be the effect? Insurgence will be quelled by supremacy, but the obtainable causes of discontent--those causes which through a long succession of trivial conflicts have at extent concluded in the present appalling issue, will linger rankling in the bosom of the nation.
