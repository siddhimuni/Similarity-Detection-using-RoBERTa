    All right! Let us learn in a soldierlike school;
  But what is the good of your Bisleys and Dovers.
    If the whole game resolves into playing the fool?
  To play that game longer and pay for it too, Sir,
    Won't suit me at all. I'm disgusted and bored.
  Your kicks for my halfpence? No, no, it won't do, Sir!
    And therefore, old Tapenoddle--take back the sword!

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.

[CONTINUED.]

March 11.--I shall have to be pretty careful in my speech to the Council. Must butter up Billsbury
like fun. How would this do? "I am young, Gentlemen, but I should have studied the political
history of my country to little purpose if I did not know that, up to the time of the last
election, the vote of Billsbury was always cast on the side of enlightenment, and Constitutional
progress. The rash and foolish experiments of those who sought to impair the glorious fabric
of our laws and our Constitution found no favour in Billsbury. It was not your fault, I know,
that this state of things has not been maintained, and that Billsbury is now groaning under
the heavy burden of a distasteful representation. Far be it from me to say one word personally
against the present Member for Billsbury. This is a political fight, and it is because his
political opinions are mistaken that you have decided to attack him"--&c., &c., &c. Must throw
in something about Conservatives being the true friends of working-men. CHUBSON is not an Eight
Hours' man, so I can go a long way. What shall I say next? Church and State, of course, Ireland
pacified and contented, glorious financial successes of present Government, steady removal
of all legitimate grievances, and triumphs of our diplomacy in all parts of the world. Shall
have to say a good word for Liberal-Unionists. TOLLAND says there are about thirty of them,
all very touchy.
