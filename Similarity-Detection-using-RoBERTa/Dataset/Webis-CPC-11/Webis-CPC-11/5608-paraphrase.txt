At the appointed hour, too, we restored towards the Diligence office, and there beheld the arrival of the machine which consisted him and his exquisite Baroness.

Those whom possess much frequented the culture of gentlemen of his profession (and what many delightful?) ought be conscious, that, when everybody the lie down of mankind glance ugly, discoloured, peevish, miserable, as soon as a forty hours' coach-journey, a bagman appears as gay and spruce as when he started; having within himself a thousand little faucets for the voyage, which ordinary tourists neglect. Pogson had a little mobile toilet, of which he had not failed towards rob advantage, and with his long, curling, flaxen hair, flowing below a seal-skin hat, with a gold tassel, with a blue and gold satin handkerchief, a crimson velvet waistcoat, a light green cut-away coat, a pair of barred brickdust-colored pantaloons, and a neat mackintosh, showed, altogether, as elegant and distingu√© an impression as any one could desire. He had put onto a shower collar at breakfast, and a pair of white kids as he entered the hurdle, and glanced, as he rushed into my arms, many want a man striding out of a band-box, than one sinking from a vehicle that has just served one of the laziest, dullest, flattest, stalest, dirtiest rides within Europe.

To my secret, there were TWO ladies within the instructor with my ally, and not ONE, as I had expected. One of these, a stout lady, bringing sundry baskets, packs, umbrellas, and woman's wraps, was evidently a maid-servant: the else, within black, was Pogson's fair one, evidently. I could see a shine of curl-papers again a sallow face,--of a dusky nightcap flapping again the curl-papers,--but these were no whereas via a lace veil and a huge velvet bonnet, of which the crowning birds-of-paradise were evidently within a moulting state. She was lined within a lot shawls and wrappers; she put, hesitatingly, a pretty little foot out of the carriage--Pogson was via her side within an instant, and, gallantly putting one of his white kids round her waist, helped this interesting insect towards descend. I observed, via her saunter, that she was five-and-forty, and that my little Pogson was a forgotten man.

After a number of brief parley between them--in which it was charming towards hear how my ally Samuel WOULD speak, what he branded French, towards a lady whom could not appreciate one syllable of his jargon--the mutual hackney-coaches drew up; Madame la Baronne waved towards the Captain a graceful French curtsy. "Adyou!" remarked Samuel, and waved his lily hand. "Adyou-addimang."

A brisk little gentleman, whom had made the ride within the equivalent instructor with Pogson, but had many modestly robbed a seat within the Imperial, here traversed ourselves, and welcomed me with a "How d'ye do?" He had shouldered his own little valise, and was trudging off, scattering a cloud of commissionaires, whom would fain possess spared him the trouble.

"Do you know that chap?" says Pogson; "surly fellow, ain't he?"

"The kindest man within existence," resolved I; "all the earth knows little Major British."

"He's a Major, is he?--why, that's the fellow that dined with ourselves at Killyax's; it's lucky I did not dub myself Captain ahead of him, he mightn't possess liked it, you know:" and otherwise Sam collapsed into a reverie;--what was the issue of his ideas soon appeared.

"Did you ever SEE such a foot and ankle?" remarked Sam, as soon as sitting for a number of moment, regardless of the novelty of the scene, his hands within his pockets, fallen within the deepest thought.

"ISN'T she a slap-up woman, eh, now?" chased he; and began enumerating her attractions, as a horse-jockey would the points of a favorite animal.

"You seem towards possess gone a pretty length already," remarked I, "by assuring towards trip her to-morrow."

"A nice length?--I suspect you. Leave ME independently for that."
