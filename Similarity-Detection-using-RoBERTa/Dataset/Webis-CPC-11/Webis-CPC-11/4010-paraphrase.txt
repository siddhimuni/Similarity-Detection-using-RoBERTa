Initially, we lived in Superior, Wisconsin, but that year, in September, we moved to Madeline Island to the land the government gave the Indians when it bought the Duluth property from them. My husband acquired the title to the better part of Minnesota Point. This land was the same four square miles in Duluth that the government gave to Chief Buffalo.

Minnesota Point is a narrow strip of land seven miles long and maybe a quarter of a mile wide; it separates Lake Superior from St. Louis Bay. We once had a picnic party with Superior folks on Minnesota Point. My husband, Orator Hall and his spouse, Mrs. Post and the Reverend Mr. Wilson from around Boston were there, as well as others. During the event we had a discussion on the new town's name and Mr. Wilson ended up recommending the name "Duluth". He made his choice to show respect to the first navigator and explorer to come up to Minnesota Point. The other proprietors came and wanted to call the land "Portland", but my husband merely stated "No that his property was in Duluth and it should stay in Duluth." I hadn't been to Duluth at that point except for the Minnesota Point picnics.

In 1858 we moved to Duluth. My husband and William, his brother, had a contract to carry the mail from Superior to St. Paul. Sometimes it was carried individually, sometimes in teams. But during certain seasons, namely the spring and fall, the roads were so bad the mail couldn't be carried in teams. Letters were delivered weekly and papers delivered monthly. The military road was still being constructed.

The experiences of the early days were much more annoying to women than it was hard for the men. Being expected to keep a clean and tidy house were greater than any difficulties the men faced.
