GREEN-HEAD GHYLL. Close to Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's house at Grasmere. 
GHYLL. A little, sharp, and fine vale with a river running through it. 
5. THE PASTORAL MOUNTAINS. In Professor Knight's Life of Wordsworth are found fragments which the writer planned for Michael and which be enhanced from Dorothy Wordsworth's document book. Among these are the following lines, which as Professor Dowden suggests, are given as Wordsworth's respond to the query, "What feeling for external nature had such a man as Michael?" The lines, which communicate to lines 62-77 of the poem, are as follows; 
"No doubt if you in terms direct had asked Whether beloved the mountains, true it is That with blunt repetition of your words He might have stared at you, and said that they Were frightful to behold, but had you then Discoursed with him . . . . . . . . Of his own business and the goings on of earth and sky, then truly had you seen that in his thoughts there were obscurities, Wonder and admiration, things that wrought not less than a religion of his heart." 
17. In Dorothy Wordsworth's diary for October 11, 1800, we read: "After dinner, we walked up Greenhead Gill in search of a sheepfold. . . The sheepfold is falling away. It is built in the form of a heart unequally divided." 
48. THE MEANING OF EVERY WIND. This is not a symbolic Statement. Michael knows by practice whether the reverberation and way of the storm forebode tempest or fair weather exactly the practical kind of information which a herdsman be supposed to own.
