Although this superb picture may be pulled in too-warm tints it is not however without its level of justness. The people of the country love flowers in the ornament of their persons, and support their growth, as well as that of several odoriferous shrubs and trees.

KANANGA.

The kananga (Uvaria cananga, L.) being a tree of the biggest size, surpassed by not many in the forest, may well take the top position, on that view, in a description of those which bear flowers.

These are of a greenish yellow, less distinguishable from the leaves, among which the bunches hang down in a unpredictable manner.

Nearing sunset, if the evening be calm, they give out a fragrance around that affects the sense at the space of few hundred yards.

CHAMPAKA.

Champaka (Michelia champaca). This tree grows in a usual, conical shape, and is ornamental in gardens. The flowers are a type of small tulip, but close and pointed at top; their colour a deep yellow, the fragrance strong, and at a distance acceptable. They are kept in the folds of the hair, both by the women, and by young men who target at gallantry.

TANJONG.

Bunga tanjong (Mimusops elengi, L.) A fair tree, rich in foliage, of a dark green; the flowers little, radiated, of a yellowish white, and worn in wreaths by the women; their fragrance, though beautiful at a distance, is too strong when brought after sunset. The fruit is a drupe, having a large blackish flatted seed.

GARDENIA.

Sangklapa (Gardenia flore simplice).
