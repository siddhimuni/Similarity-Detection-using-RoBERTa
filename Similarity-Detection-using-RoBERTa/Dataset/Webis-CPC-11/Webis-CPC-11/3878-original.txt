    [3] A Turkish saying, much in use.

The dragoman then concluding, that instead of waiting to cross over himself, he was expecting
the arrival of some one from the opposite side of the Golden Horn, stepped into his cäik, which
instantly glided from the quay and shot across the port. The boats at Constantinople are all
very light and sharp, and go with astonishing speed, even when propelled with one pairs of
oars; but people of high consideration, like dragomans, generally have two pairs to their cäiks,
and at this time M. ---- being in a very great hurry, told his two rowers to pull as fast as
they could.

When about half way on his short aquatic journey, M. ---- turned his head and looked back,
and then he saw at the end of the quay, just where he had left him, the tall African standing
starch and motionless, like a granite statue before an Egyptian temple.

The dragoman's boat continued to cleave the waves; it neared the opposite shore--no cäik had
passed him on his way--when lo! as his own came in concussion with the wooden piles of the
Divan-kapi-iskellesi, and he rose from his seat to step on shore, he saw the identical African
wizard standing there before him, and gazing calmly over to the opposite quay where he had
just left him, and whence it was impossible he could have proceeded by mortal agency!

The dragoman rubbed his eyes, as well he might; but there was the Maugrabee, with his large
leaden eye gazing across the Golden Horn, and fixed on the wharf of the dead, just as he had
been left behind there gazing at the Divan-kapi-iskellesi.
