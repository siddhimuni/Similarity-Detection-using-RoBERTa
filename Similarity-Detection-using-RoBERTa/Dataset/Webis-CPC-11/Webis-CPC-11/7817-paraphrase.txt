He was the final person released before the basic dispersal of all. For those whose terms of service continued beyond the beginning of October were, on the 13th, sent to and commanded to become part of the Fifth Regiment. From E Company, those affected are Bryan, Foglesang, Frank, Hildebrandt, Holtzmer, Iwan, Knopf, Lieber, and Troska. During its time at Montgomery -- since a replacement of captains had occurred in D Company -- E Company moved to a first-place ranking. The assigned location in the regiment's formation became the leading spot on the right-side flank; Company I was at its left. 

Following prolonged periods of exhaustive waiting, the company was finally given the command to travel to Vicksburg for dispersal and, happily, breaking down camp for the final time, left for Selma on the 16th -- via the steamer Coquette -- and arrived the following day. Now, instead of leaving immediately, the group stayed for several days due to new thinking regarding the recently-transferred men. The transfer directive was cancelled and they rejoined their regiments for dispersal with the group as a whole. The power of E Company now broke down this way: 60 present and accounted for; 6 not present, for an aggregate of 62.

Departed Selma by train on the 20th. Arrived at Demopolis by mid-day and traveled down its river four miles via steamboat to the point where the train tracks picked up again, a west bank location called McDowell's Landing. Set up camp for an overnight stay at this location. Traveled the following day to Meridian, Mississippi and camped overnight there. The following day, the 22nd, traveled opposite Jackson to Pearl River. Due to the ruination of the bridge which formerly spanned the water -- as well as that of the Big Black -- there was a thirty-mile area of railroad non-communication which required traversing in the smartest possible manner.
