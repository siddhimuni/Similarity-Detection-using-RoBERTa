In any case when you viewed Oberan at His Majesty's, swaying gently in sylvan dress through what was both a wood and looked like a wood (and as such kept your mind available to listen to him),you found yourself able to trust in all the beautiful things he said; but upon seeing Mr. Barker's Oberon stark and on his feet, resembling a solemn painting with red eyebrows and yellow cheeks, against a background of symbolic painted cloth, and informing you that he knows of a bank where the uncultivated thyme blows, you are aware he knows nothing of the sort; and so you do not believe any of it.

But leaving SHAKSPEARE out of this as is decent: I very much liked the golden dresses the fairies wore, as long as Puck, who is a kind of grown-up Struwel-Puck and bothered me greatly, was absent from the scene. Puck's loud scarlet suit matched only several vermillion eyebrows and ruined the color scheme. I was a fan of the uncomplicated and graceful chain-dances upon the green mound (note: these are English dances and tunes, as opposed to Indian). Still, during the final scene, in which they interweave themselves amidst the staring columns, I thought that their motions possessed an absence of space. Yes, that was the problem throughout, that and the unsparing light that flowed onto the stage from 12.6 points on the perimeter of the dress-circle. There was a lack of distance, a lack of any sense of the spirit-world, and a lack of mystery (with the exception of Mr. BARKER's intent).

The scene about the haunt of Titania was the best. The Liberty curtains in the background were a clever touch, however, they seemed slightly arbitrary as symbols for the forest. I am not opposed to having indications of a forest if you are short on trees. The indications might take the form of a few actual trees in tubs, or even just one, but somehow, and this is probably more my fault than anything else, the image of drapes hanging did not convey to me the idea of birds' nests.
