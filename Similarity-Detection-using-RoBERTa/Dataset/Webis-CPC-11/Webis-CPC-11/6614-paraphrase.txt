My speciality is that I treat everyone to be equal and to be my own.

The public has created my picture.My instruction is wise in the caswe of liberty, truth, essence.Moreover I disdain to introduce even the little common and provincial rules into the list of real dutieswhich comes under the category of civility and ceremony,though not legal.Surely, the vices of appearance will be had by us when those essence is had by us.After having done these,the others are fully driven upon by us,when found that it must be so,as there is a danger that new offices shall be fancied by usto excuse for the natural one's negligence.In order to confound and manifest it,have we not found that where faults are crimes' crimes are faults?We observe the primitive laws of common reason in nations where we find laws of decency to be most rare and remiss. Our care is being stifled and dissipated by the innumerable multitude of duties.

We are being diverted from the necessary and just by our application to light and trivial things.

When compared to ours, these superficial mentake an easy and plausible way.

We palliate and pay one another with those shadows. Though we don't pay,but towards that great judge, the reckoning is inflamed,the rags and tatters above our shameful parts are being tucked,without viewing us all over,even our inmost and most secret ordures.To keep him from this discovery is a decency of our maidenly modesty.

No great disservice would be done to reclaim a man fromso scrupulous a verbalo superstition.
