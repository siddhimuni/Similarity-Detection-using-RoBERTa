The opposite opinion still has its believers, even of well-educated men across the globe, at least in all democracies and constitutional monarchies. The principle that institutions similar to those of Britain may be safely imposed on other countries is the guiding principal in the encouragement of revolutions in other countries such as Belgium, Portugal, Span, and many South American republics. Among these states alone can we now look for support and alliance. 

The failure of these alien institutions in all of these countries (The aggressive and hostile United States, the failure of the English system in Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Latin America) has not changed this erroneous opinion among most of the men in this country. 

Apparently, several generations must pass before these ideas disappear from common thought through experience and suffering. Men vainly and proudly cling to their beliefs even despite the clear evidence of wisdom and experience. The Roman Catholic Church was correct in saying that pride is the most difficult sin to conquer in a man's heart.

An example will here illustrate how Montesquieu supported the other view point, that the institutions of a society are influenced and formed by the particular character and history of a nation, and not the other way around. For example, primogeniture, even thought it was alien to the Romans or most of Northern Europe came to be universally adopted within the feudal system and the rise of military aristocracy in every European country.
