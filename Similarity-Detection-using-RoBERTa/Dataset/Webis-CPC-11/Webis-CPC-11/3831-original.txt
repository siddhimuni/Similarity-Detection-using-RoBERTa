There was also a famous violinist--well, you can see already
that Patuffa's vernal experiences were on generous lines. It is to the credit of all concerned
that she and her story retain an appreciable charm under adverse conditions.

Nothing, one would imagine, could promise much more restful reading than a book that concerns
itself with such things as christening robes for caterpillars, the dyeing blue of white chickens
and searches among Californian lilies and pine-trees for the soul of a hog unseasonably defunct.
But, since this most uncharitable age refuses to believe anything just because it is told it
should, the peaceful pages of The Diary of Opal Whiteley (PUTNAM) are unfortunately fussed
over with a controversy that no one who reads them can quite escape. Miss WHITELEY'S diary
is presented with every circumstance of solemn asseveration as the unaided work of a child
of seven, only now pieced together by the writer after quite a number of years. If you care
to throw yourself into the argument you will certainly find heaps of reasons for thinking unkind
thinks, as the writer would say, of the truth of this claim, particularly in the completeness
with which every incident is carried through various stages to its literary finish; but, if
you will be ruled by me, you will try to forget anything but the book itself, with its quite
charming pictures of many animals and one little girl, their understanding friend. The quaint
idiom in which the diary is supposed to have been written (or, of course, was written) adds
to the delight of a rather uncommon feeling for nature at its simplest, while the scrapes for
which the small heroine receives (or, you may say, is alleged to receive) well-deserved punishment
preserve the book from ever dropping into mere mawkishness.
