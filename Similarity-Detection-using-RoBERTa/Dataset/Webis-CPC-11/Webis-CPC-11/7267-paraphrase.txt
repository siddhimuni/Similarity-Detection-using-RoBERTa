Lancelot was moping about the castle one day when he came upon the lady of the house.

"Lancelot, you're usually so suave.  What's got you down?  Is something wrong?  Let's talk about it.  You can trust me.  I won't spill your secrets to anyone else."

Lancelot looked up from his moping and responded to the lady.  "It should be obvious why I'm upset.  All the king's good people are at the tournament and I'm locked up in this castle.  Could you get me released for just a day?  I promise to return."

The lady of the house told she would let him out if she could but that she was afraid of the despicable Meleagant.

"Meleagant would kill my husband if I let you out.  I know you will understand if I'm afraid of him.  He is a very bad man."

Lancelot didn't give up.  "If you are afraid that I won't come back, I will take an oath which I will never break, that nothing will keep me from returning to this prison."

"Ok," she responded, "I'll do it on one condition, that you will swear not only to return to the prison but that you'll give me your heart as well."

"Done.  All the love I have is yours."

The lady of the house laughed and said "I know you are in love with someone else, but I'll take what I can get.  I accept your oath."

So Lancelot swore an oath by the Holy Church that he would return to his prison without fail.  The lady of the house even equipped him for the tournamed by giving him Lord Meleagant's vermillion arms and a good, strong, brave horse.
