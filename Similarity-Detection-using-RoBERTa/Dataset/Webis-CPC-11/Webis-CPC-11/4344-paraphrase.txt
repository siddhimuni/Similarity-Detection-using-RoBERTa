Chemical Decomposition happens when there is an accumulation of ether waves that causes the atoms to separate into simpler compounds or elements. 

The first person to show the influence of musical sounds on liquid jets was Savart. Here is an experiment from his class:

I opened the valve on the sink to allow a small stream of water to fall into a container. I arranged the flow so that it was continuos and uninterrupted. I tried raising my voice and shouting to see if there was a reaction on the stream, and there was none. I then tried higher tones and although they were powerful and ear-piercing, there was still no effect. Finally, I tried a low tone of about 130 vibrations a second. This affected the stream tremendously. As the low resonance collided with the water, the stream shortened by one half and the end of the stream scattered water all over. Immediately, when the note ceased, the stream returned to it's original percision. 

Unproven notions, hypothesies of my own tell me that when absorption occurs the motion of ether-waves is affected by the surrounding atoms and molecules. It is possible that the ether waves, making their way through foreign molecules might influence motion into other molecules. Like a domimo effect. But other experimentations disprove my theory as with vapors. If the atoms were affected by motion alone, they would not experience chemical decomposition and would maintain their original make-up.
