It is next to impossible for a gentleman in the United States to do such a thing.   If he did, he would reduce himself to the level of a snob.  Therefore, I would treat him as I would any snob that I would meet on any street by knocking him down, if I could.  If I could not knock him down, I would let the law handle him. If the man has harmed me irreparably, I would consider acting like the uncivilized Southerners who are known for shooting people down in the streets.  It does not make any sense to challenge this man to a dual. If a man steals your coat, he should not have the option of a participating in a dual when he should be sent to prison instead.  
Another issue that is very disturbing is when a man spreads false rumors about someone being a cheat or is accused of not being a gentleman.  
However, the response from Benson was different.  He said this reaction was outlandish because he could not fight all the people that had spread false reports about him.  If he did, he would have his hands too full.  He also said that there was a man in the room that had slandered him as harshly as he could four years ago.  This slander nearly caused his marriage to break up.  He pointed to a man in the room and stated “that fat man there, with all the jewelry.  His name is Storey Hunter.”   
With surprise, the other man stated, “Indeed! He had just seen Mrs. Benson talking with the man who had the jewelry and they were on good terms.
Benson also said that he did not give the scamp of a man any reason.  With anger, Benson turned very white and then very red.  He was angry about his wife as well as the other women who were eager to dance with any man that had the ability to dance well.  These women have no self-respect.
