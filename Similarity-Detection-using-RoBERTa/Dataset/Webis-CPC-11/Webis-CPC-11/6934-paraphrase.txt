ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 

EDITED BY M. Ida Tarbell. 

Lincoln as a shopkeeper AND SOLDIERS IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR. 

This article incorporates special studies of the life of Lincoln in New Salem made for this magazine by J. McCan Davis. 

FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS. 

It was in March 1830, when Abraham Lincoln was twenty years old, who moved from Illinois to Macon County, Illinois. He spent his first spring in the new country by helping his father nods. 

In the summer of that year began for himself, doing different types of rough farm work in the area until March 1831, when he went to Sangamon town, near Springfield, the construction of a barge. 

In April at the barge to New Orleans, where he arrived in May. After a month in that city, returned in June, to Illinois, where he made a brief visit to his parents, now in Coles County, and in July went to New Salem, to take charge of a store and a mill owned by Denton Offutt, who had been employed on the barge. [A] The products for the new store had not arrived when Lincoln arrived in New Salem. 

Forced to turn his hand to anything, driven by the Sangamon and Illinois rivers, as Beardstown, a barge carrying the family and a pioneer goods bound for Texas. 

In Beardstown found Offutt goods waiting to be taken to New Salem. 

The legs his way home he met two men with a cart and oxen-going for the goods. 

Offutt expected Lincoln to wait at Beardstown to a yoke of oxen came, and the truckers who do not have any credentials, asked Lincoln to give an order for goods. 

This, sitting by the roadside, he wrote out, and one of the men used to relate that contains a misspelled word, which rectified. 

STORE MANAGER Denton Offutt. 

The exact date of the opening of Denton Offutt's store is not known. We only know that on 8 July 1831, the County Commissioners Court Offutt Sangamon County granted a license to retail merchandise at New Salem, for which he paid five dollars, a rate that is assumed that he has a thousand dollars worth of goods in stock. 

When the oxen and their drivers returned with the goods, the store opened in a small hut at the edge of the hill, almost on the River. 

The copy of Kirkham Grammar studied by Lincoln belonged to a man named Vaner. Some of the biographers of Lincoln provided [that], but apparently became the owner of the book, either by purchase or through the generosity of Vaner, since it was never returned to the second. It is said that Lincoln learned grammar almost by heart. 

"Sometimes," says Herndon, "which extend the entire length of the counter with his head resting on a stack of calico prints, studying it, would rob the welcoming shade of a tree, and not spend hours at a time in a determined effort to fix in his mind the arbitrary rule that "Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. '" 

Presentation of the book of Ann Rutledge [the story of Ann Rutledge will appear in a future issue of the magazine], and since then has been one of the Rutledge family treasures. After Ann's death was investigated by his brother, Robert, and now owned by his widow, who lives in Casselton, North Dakota. 

The book's cover above. The words "Ann M. Rutledge is learning grammar," were written by Lincoln.
