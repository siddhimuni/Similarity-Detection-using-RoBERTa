The bigger part of the journal is loaded up with a succession of messages conveyed by one of these prisoners to his mother. Perhaps (one suspects) the journalist of these was not utterly an common youthful man. From no matter what justification, the item stays that his messages are by no signifies uncheery reading; his journals and study, most of all his friendships (with one fellow-captive especially), look like to have kept him contented and even happy. Of course some part of this may well have been colour sheltering for the maternal eye; it is clear that he was highly afraid that she should not be too apprehensive about him. A more impartial film of the circumstances at Ruhleben is bestowed in the second part of the size, and in a message by Sir TIMOTHY EDEN, reprinted from The Times, on The Case for a wholesale Exchange of Civilian Prisoners. I should add that the journal is demonstrated with some drawings of Ruhleben made by Mr. STANLEY GRIMM, an artisan of the Expressionist School (whatever that may mean). These are vigorous and arresting, if, to the unmodern eye, to some extent formless. But they are part of a record that all Englishmen can study with quickened compassion and a many self-respect in the valour and supply of our run under circumstances needlessly brutal at their least, and not ever better than just endurable.

Nothing will ever argue me that This Way Out (METHUEN) is an bewitching label for a new, even so effectual it may be as a discern in a trains station. The journal itself, even so, is intriguing in spite of its gloominess. The grandfather of Jane and John-Andrew Vaguener dedicated a most cold-blooded murder--this in a prologue. Then, when we get to the actual narrative, we find Jane tapping out admired fiction at an astounding step, and her male kin, John-Andrew, residing on the progresses thereof.
