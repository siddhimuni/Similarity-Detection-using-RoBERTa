St. Athanasius tells the pagans, they have been witnesses themselves
that the sign of the cross puts the devils to flight, silences oracles, and dissipates enchantments.

This power of silencing oracles, and putting the devils to flight, is also attested by Arnobius,
Lactantius, Prudentius, Minutius, Felix, and several others. Their testimony is a certain proof
that the coming of the Messiah had not imposed a general silence on oracles.

The Emperor Julian, called the Apostate, consulting the oracle of Apollo, in the suburbs of
Antioch, the devil could make him no other answer, than that the body of St. Babylas, buried
in the neighbourhood, imposed silence on him. The Emperor, transported with rage and vexation,
resolved to revenge his gods, by eluding a solemn prediction of Christ. He ordered the Jews
to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem; but in beginning to dig the foundations, balls of fire
burst out, and consumed the artificers, their tools and materials. These facts are attested
by Ammianus Marcellinus, a pagan, and the emperor's historian; and by St. Chrysostom, St. Gregory
Nazianzen, and Theodoret, Sozomen and Socrates, in their ecclesiastical histories. The sophist
Libanius, who was an enemy of the Christians, confessed also that St. Babylas had silenced
the oracle of Apollo, in the suburbs of Antioch.

Plutarch relates that the pilot Thamus heard a voice in the air, crying out:--"The great Pan
is dead:" whereupon Eusebius observes, that the deaths of the demons were frequent in the reign
of Tiberius, when Christ drove out the wicked spirits. The same judgments may be passed on
oracles as on possessions. It was on particular occasions, by the divine permission, that the
Christians cast out devils, or silenced oracles, in the presence and even by the confession
of the pagans themselves.
