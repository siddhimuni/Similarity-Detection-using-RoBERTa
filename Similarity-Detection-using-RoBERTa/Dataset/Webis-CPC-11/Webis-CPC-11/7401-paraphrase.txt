On that warm spring day, I saw you in your room pulling your stocking up your shapely leg and it was like a star burst in the attic.  Despite having studied Plato in depth, I could not remember a thing.  Even the French philosophers in search of truth could not inspire me any more than your goodness and beauty. I would do anything for you and you for me.  The sight of you in the morning as you dressed and watched your reflection in the mirror was heaven.

Who could forget those days? Days of sunrises and dreams, and rich and silken fabrics, when love was all around us and present in every word we spoke?

In our garden there was a pot of tulips.  You covered the windows with your slip. I took the stoneware bowl and offered you the Japanese cup.  We laughed about hard times.  The time when I burnt my shirt.  The time when you lost your scarf.  The time when we were so poor that we had to sell a treasured painting to buy food.  You were so good to me, to stay with me.  I grabbed you and kissed you all over.  We turned an old atlas into a table at which we happily ate our meagre dinner.  But I loved that home.  Because that was the first place I kissed you.  You blushed and acted shy but I knew at that instant that there was a God.

Do you remember those same joys and days of passion?
