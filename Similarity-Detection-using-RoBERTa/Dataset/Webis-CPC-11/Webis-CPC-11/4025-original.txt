The malarious or marsh
poison, which in our colder latitudes produces common ague, in the warmer, remittent fever,
and in unfavourable southern localities of Europe, (such as those of crowded towns, where the
heat has been steadily for some time of an intertropical degree)--true yellow fever, which
is no more than the highest grade of malarious disease; but this has never occurred in European
towns, unless during the driest seasons--seasons actually blighted by drought, when hot withering
land winds have destroyed surface vegetation, and as in the locality of Gibraltar, have left
the low-lying becalmed, and leeward town to corrupt without perflation or ventilation amidst
its own accumulated exhalations. I know not how I can better illustrate the situation of Gibraltar
in these pestiferous seasons, than by a quotation from a report of my own on the Island of
Guadaloupe, in the year 1816, which, though written without any possible reference to the question
at issue, has become more apposite than anything else I could advance; "all regular currents
of wind have the effect of dispersing malaria; when this purifying influence is with-held,
either through the circumstances of season, or when it cannot be made to sweep the land on
account of the intervention of high hills, the consequences are most fatal. The leeward shores
of Guadaloupe, for a course of nearly 30 miles, under the shelter of a very steep ridge of
volcanic mountains, never felt the sea breeze, nor any breeze but the night land-wind from
the mountains; and though the soil, which I have often examined, is a remarkably open, dry
and pure one, being mostly sand and gravel, altogether, and positively without marsh, in the
most dangerous places, it is inconceivably pestiferous throughout the whole tract, and in no
place more so than the bare sandy beach near the high-water mark. The coloured people alone
ever venture to inhabit it; and when they see strangers tarrying on the shore after nightfall,
they never fail to warn them of their danger.
