Anyhow, when at His Majesty's you saw Oberon in sylvan dress moving lightly through a wood
that looked like a wood (and so left your mind free to listen to him), you could believe in
all the lovely things he had to say; but when you saw Mr. BARKER'S Oberon standing stark, like
a painted graven image, with yellow cheeks and red eyebrows, up against a symbolic painted
cloth, and telling you that he knows a bank where the wild thyme blows, you know quite well
that he knows nothing of the kind; and you don't believe a word of it.

But, to leave SHAKSPEARE decently out of the question, I liked the gold dresses of the fairies
enormously, so long as Puck--a sort of adult Struwel-Puck that got badly on my nerves--was
not there, destroying every colour scheme with his shrieking scarlet suit, which went with
nothing except a few vermilion eyebrows. I liked too the grace of their simple chain-dances
on the green mound (English dances, you will note, and English tunes--not Indian). But in the
last scene, where they interlace among the staring columns, their movements lacked space. Indeed
that was the trouble all through; that, and the pitiless light that poured point-blank upon
the stage from the 12.6 muzzles protruding from the bulwarks of the dress-circle. There was
no distance, no suggestion of the spirit-world, no sense of mystery (except in regard to Mr.
BARKER'S intentions).

The best scene was the haunt of Titania, with its background of Liberty curtains very cleverly
disposed. As drapery they were excellent, but as symbols of a forest I found them a little
arbitrary. I do not mind a forest being indicated, if you are short of foliage, by a couple
of trees (in tubs, if you like) or even a single tree; but somehow--and the fault is probably
mine--the spectacle of hanging drapery does not immediately suggest to me the idea of birds'
nests.
