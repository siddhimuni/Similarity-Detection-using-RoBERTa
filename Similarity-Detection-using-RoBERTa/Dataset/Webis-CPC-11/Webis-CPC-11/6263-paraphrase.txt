The ship, a screw steamer with ship's rigging, was commanded by Captain Weikhmann and successfully captured many other ships on the coast of France during the Franco-German war of 1870-71. On January 4,1871, she took the French ship St. Marc which carried flour and bread for the French army. Augusta also captured the Pierre Adolph which was bringing wheat from Havre to Bordeaux.

The design of metal wheels, invented by Mr. H.J. Barrett, was made in two categories: Class A was designed for uneven terrain, while Class B used mild steel spokes that could be taken out and fixed more easily. These removable spokes made the wheel stronger and helped it to resist side strains from ruts or holes in the road. The bosses and straps were also made of soft iron, fitted with steel oil caps that were attached with a small set screw, so that it was not necessary to take off the cap to lubricate the wheel. The set screw also functioned as a fulcrum for a key, so that the cap could be removed on rough roads if necessary. In hot and dry weather, the shrinking of wood and loosening of tires was a constant nuisance, but the new and improved wheel was made of metal, which contracted and expanded equally in all climates. The Class B wheels were designed with the same idea as the Class A wheels, but used cast metal bosses or naves, and were more suitable for easier roads without rough terrain.
