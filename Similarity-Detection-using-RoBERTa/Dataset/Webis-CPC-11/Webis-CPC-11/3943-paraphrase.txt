The different groups passed in silence and appeared in perfect discipline.Orders were given by whistles never speaking a word.
With a funeral slowness they marched in death like stillness and in single file .They marched and marched through the town.
One column was going northe the other was heading south.This cross over kept the line going in continuity in almost unbroken lines.
The effect was creating a impression of hugh numbers and they kept this up for almost 2 hours.Then the Klan left as quiet as they came they were gone. The crowd that gather was more than they had been before mystified. Curiosity grew instead of being satisfied. The efforts of the cunning to know who the Klan was failed. A country man into the city who was said to know every horse in the county was sure he could identify the riders from their horses. He stayed in town to identify the riders. The Klan had disguised the horses as well as themselves.He would not be baffled as one rider stopped near him he lifted the cover to find his own horse and saddle.The rider never tried to stop him.The town was aware and looked to see who in their town was with the Ku Klux.They looked to see who in the crowd of spectators was missing only to find that most young men of the town were in the crowd and with the spectators.The Klan had kept the towns young men out of the parade.

The demonstration achieved its goals. The greatest illusion seemed to be the numbers of participants. People with good judgment, were sure that the numbers were at least three thousand.
