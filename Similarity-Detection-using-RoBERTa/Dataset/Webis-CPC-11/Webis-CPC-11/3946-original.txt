They are first put into a large
pan and covered with boiling water. This loosens the skin, which is easily removed, and the
tomatoes are then put into the preserving kettle, set over a moderate fire without the addition
of water or any seasoning, and brought to a boil. After boiling slowly one-half hour, they
are put into the jars while boiling hot and sealed tightly. They will keep two or three years
in this way. The jars should be filled to the brim to prevent air from getting in, and set
in a cool, dark closet.

TO CAN CORN.

Split the kernels lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the back of the knife, thus leaving
the hulls upon the cob. Fill cans full of cut corn, pressing it in very hard. To press the
corn in the can, use the small end of a potato masher, as this will enter the can easily. It
will take from ten to a dozen large ears of corn to fill a one-quart can. When the cans are
full, screw cover on with thumb and first finger; this will be tight enough, then place a cloth
in the bottom of a wash boiler to prevent breakage. On this put a layer of cans in any position
you prefer, over the cans put a layer of cloth, then a layer of cans. Fill the boiler in this
manner, then cover the cans well with cold water, place the boiler on the fire and boil three
hours without ceasing. On steady boiling depends much of your success. After boiling three
hours, lift the boiler from the fire, let the water cool, then take the cans from the boiler
and tighten, let them remain until cold, then tighten again. Wrap each can in brown paper to
exclude the light and keep in a cool, dry cellar and be very sure the rubber rings are not
hardened by use. The rings should be renewed every two years. I would advise the beginner to
use new rings entirely, for poor rings cause the loss of canned fruit and vegetables in many
cases. You will observe that in canning corn the cans are not wrapped in a cloth nor heated;
merely filled with the cut corn.
