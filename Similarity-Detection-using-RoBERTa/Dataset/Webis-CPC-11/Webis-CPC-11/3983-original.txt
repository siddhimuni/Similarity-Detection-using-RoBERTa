CYTOLOGY (cell word), the study of the cell, the constituent unit of organisms.

DETERMINER (completely end), an element or condition in a germ-cell, supposed to be essential
to the development of a particular quality, feature, or manner of reaction of the organism
which arises from that germ-cell. The word is gradually falling into disuse, and "factor" taking
its place.

DOMINANCE (mastery), in Mendelian hybrids the capacity of a character which is derived from
only one of two generating gametes to develop to an extent nearly or quite equal to that exhibited
by an individual which has derived the same character from both of the generating gametes.
In the absence of dominance the given character of the hybrid usually presents a "blend" or
intermediate condition between the two parents.

DYSGENIC (bad origin), tending to impair the racial qualities of future generations; the opposite
of eugenic.

ENDOGAMY (within mating), a custom of some primitive peoples, in compliance with which a man
must choose his wife from his own group (clan, gens, tribe, etc.).

EUGENIC (good origin), tending to improve the racial qualities of future generations, either
physical or mental.

EUTHENIC (good thriving), tending to produce beneficial acquired characters or better conditions
for people to live in, but not tending (except incidentally and indirectly) to produce people
who can hand on the improvement by heredity.

EVOLUTION (unroll), ORGANIC, the progressive change of living forms, usually associated with
the development of complex from simple forms.

EXOGAMY (out mating), a custom of primitive peoples which requires a man to choose a wife from
some other group (clan, gens, tribe, etc.) than his own.

FACTOR (maker), a name given to the hypothetical something, the independently inheritable element
in the germ-cell, whose presence is necessary to the development of a certain inherited character
or characters or contributes with other factors to the development of a character.
