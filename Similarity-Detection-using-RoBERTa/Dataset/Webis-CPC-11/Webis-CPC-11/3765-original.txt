Above that sum, 4 percent, interest is paid. The owner
is at liberty to withdraw the principal at will. The tables published in 1845, after twenty
years' existence, afford a most satisfactory and interesting result. The increase of members
who partake of the benefits has steadily advanced. One-third of the number are inhabitants
of Libau, the remainder are from the country. A very important gain was also perceived to arise
from the system: a large portion of the silver rubles and Albert-dollars paid in, had evidently
been for many years kept entirely out of circulation, buried in pots in the earth, and consequently
in such a condition, that it was often necessary to have the coin carefully cleaned, before
it was fit to be sent out into circulation again. Besides the pecuniary advantage, the improvement
in the character of the people has been remarkable. The savings-bank has strengthened in a
singular degree the love of order, industry, and temperance. How many cheerful hopes and anticipations
are connected with savings! It has been ascertained, both in England and France, that since
the establishment of savings-banks in those countries, no criminal has ever been found to have
been a member of one. How true a benefactor to his country has the young merchant Hagedom proved
himself to be! May he live long to direct the savings-bank of his native town of Libau! And,
to conclude with the words of the last report of the institution: 'May a gracious Providence
continue to prosper this first and oldest institution of the kind in the empire of Russia,
and preserve this institution, so highly beneficial to the economical and moral state of the
people, in its full prosperity, to future generations!'[7]
