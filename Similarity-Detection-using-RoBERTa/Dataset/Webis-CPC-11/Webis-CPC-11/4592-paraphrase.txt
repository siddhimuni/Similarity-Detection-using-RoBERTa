I frequently dreaded that one of the accidents that he isn't protected against would happen. It had happened. My Guardian was a gentleman, treating me with respect and courtesy. Mr. Cranley even gave me his own rooms, in Victoria Square. He had assumed a false name, and was goith by "Lithgow". He told me that it was necessary, that it was my fathers last wish that this and the ruse of the telegrm be done. 



Even if I had suspicions that he was anything but a gentleman, I was too sick to focus on it. He was a friend of my Father's, older and much more acceptable a gaurdian than Maitland. I was completing his wish, though I hoped that soon I would become independant. 

I considered Crabley my protector, a savior of sorts. The instinct of Self Prservation was alive and well in him, unmodified as it has been in most people. His temper too, was they same as that of our ancient ancestors.
