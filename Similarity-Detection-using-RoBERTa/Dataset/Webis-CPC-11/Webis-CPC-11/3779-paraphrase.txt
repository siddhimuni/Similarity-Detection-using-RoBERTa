The pagans were told that they had witnessed the power of the sign of the cross to cause devils to fly away, oracles to be silent, and enchantments to dissipate. It was St. Athanasius that made them aware of this. Arnobius, Lactanius, Prudentius, Minutius, Felix, and others described these same powers.  This proves that the Messiah's arrival did not silence the oracles completely.

The Emperor Julian (the Apostate) consulted the oracle of Apollo. The devil could only answer that he was silenced by the body of St. Babylas, which was buried in the neighborhood. The Emperor was vexed and enraged. He decided to avenge his gods by eluding the prediction that Christ had made. He ordered that the Jerusalem temple be rebuilt, by the Jews. As soon as the Jews started to dig the foundation, however, they were consumed by balls of fire, as were their tools and materials. Ammianus Marcellinus, St. Chrysostom, St. Gregory Nazianzen, Theodoret, Sozomen, and Socrates all attested to this occurrence. Libanius, a sophist and enemy of the Christians, admitted that St. Babylas had silenced Apollo's oracle in those suburbs.

According to Plutarch, Thamus, a pilot, heard a voice in the air. The voice cried out, "The great Pan is dead." Eusebius observed, then, that demons frequently died in Tiberius when Christ drove out bad spirits. Oracles and posessions may be judged in the same way. On some occasions, by God's permission, the Christians cast out devils or silenced oracles even when pagans were present.
