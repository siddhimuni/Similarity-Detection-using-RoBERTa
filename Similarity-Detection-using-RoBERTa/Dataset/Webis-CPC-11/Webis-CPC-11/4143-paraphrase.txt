Melchior said in a loud voice, "Jean-Christophe, did you hear that? Poor Fritz is dead."

The boy replied quietly, "Yes, papa." His chest felt like it was in a vise.

Melchior went on, "'Yes, papa.' Is that all you can say? Doesn't it make you sad?"

Louisa, who understood how the child felt, said, "'Ssh! Let him sleep!"

They talked quietly but Jean-Christophe could hear them discussing the typhoid fever, the cold baths, delirium, the parents' grief. He could hardly breathe and the lump in his throat choked him. He shuddered as he imagined all these horrible things. He heard them say that the disease was contagious. He froze in terror when he remembered that he had shaken hands with Fritz the last time he saw him, so that meant he could have it too. He kept quiet so he wouldn't have to talk to his parents. After the neighbor left, his father asked him, "Jean-Christophe, are you asleep?" but he didn't answer. He heard Melchior saying to Louisa, "The boy has no feelings."

Louisa said nothing, but gently raised the curtain to check on the little boy. Jean-Christophe quickly closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. Louisa went away quietly but he wished she would stay so he could tell her he was afraid, and have her comfort him. But he knew they would make fun of him and call him a coward, and nothing they could say would help him anyway. He lay there in agony for hours, imagining the disease creeping over him, pains in his head, his heart failing, and thinking in terror, "It is the end. I am ill. I am going to die. I am going to die!". Once he sat up and called to his mother in a low voice; but they were asleep, and he didn't dare wake them.

Throughout his childhood he was obsessed with the idea of death. He imagined all kinds of illnesses just waiting to kill him. Even though his mother was close by she never knew the constant agony he was going through.
