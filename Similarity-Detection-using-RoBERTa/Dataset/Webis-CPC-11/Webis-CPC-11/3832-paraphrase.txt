You cannot think of a more impactful image.  The river is amazingly rapid and crystal clear, with a bed full of rocks, and the banks seem to be rock faces that go straight up for a signigicant distance down the shorline.  I hear that in the winter, the Aar often causes a lot of trouble as it has a lot of water and is the perfect example of a gushing mountain stream.  This reminded me of the streams found in Wales, especially the ones in some parts of the Dee.  I arrived in Brohl a little late due to this detour that took a little longer than I thought it would.  However, I arrived in time for dinner at the old Gasthoff.  I enjoyed my meal and a flask of Rhenish wine with a new German friend who was staying there as well and this made up for all the difficulties of the day.

I was hit with the pieces of lava rock and burnt remains of trees and bushes spattered over the marshes as I took off from Brohl along the Brohl Stream that comes from Lake Laach.  Soon, I arrived at the valley made of tufa, or trass as it is known in the country.  Tufa is a dull blue colored hard clay that, when dry, becomes a shade of light gray.  This stones is very popular in Holland and so is quarried  in the valley and sent along the Rhine.  A Dutchmann settled Nippes a century ago for its great location for exporting trass.  The stone found at the bottom of the formation is preferred as it is the hardest and most dense.  The upper part is loose and sandy, and therefore not useful.  Since the Brohl Stream is really only a liquified river of trass, it is thick as pea-soup, and is not clear like the Aar.
