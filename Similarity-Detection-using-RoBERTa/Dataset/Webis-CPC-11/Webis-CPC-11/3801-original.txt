Agnes Jones was not one of those who are always

     "Seeking for some great thing to do,"

and ignoring the many small opportunities of service which lie ready to hand. She was quite
content, since the larger field was not yet open to her, to occupy a smaller one. In a letter
to her aunt she wrote very characteristically:--"I am trying and succeeding more and more in
fixing my eyes on all the little things we shall be able to do. I believe in this is our safety,
doing the daily littles as opportunity is given, and leaving the issue with God. It is the
individual influence we shall have, the individual relief and the individual help for mind
and body, that will be ours. If it is His will, He can make others see the many littles as
one great whole, or they may see nothing done, while we have the comfort of the littles we
know have been done."

The nurses and probationers arrived in the middle of May, and then work began in good earnest.
The post of lady superintendent was by no means a sinecure. At 5.30 every morning she might
have been seen unlocking the doors for the kitchen-women. She was often round the wards at
6.0, and all through the busy day until 11.0 at night she was kept fully employed, giving out
stores, superintending her nurses, presiding at meals, and visiting patients, besides all the
hundred-and-one duties and calls which fall to one in the like position. Her unselfishness
was as conspicuous as ever, and she never thought of sparing herself in any way, her joy being
to make the lives of others bright and happy.
