But there is one man - Greatorex we call him - who is the captain recognized and Primus all whist-players. We all secretly admire him. I, on my side, watching him in private life, listen to what he says, note what he orders for dinner, and have a sense of admiration for him that I used to have as a school boy cock. Do not play at whist? "Quelle Triste viellesse esssentially prepare vous vous!" words were great and good Bishop of Autun. I can not. It's too late now. Too late! too late! Ah! humiliating confession! Like joy was tight, but life has swept us stream it - fast rushing stream to the sea life is approaching. Too late! too late! Twentystone my boy! when you read in the papers "Valse a deux temps," and all the fashionable dances taught the adult Miss Lightfoots, "Do not think that you would like to go in and learn? Oh, it's too late! You passed choreas Master Twentystone, and young people are dancing without you.

I do not think much of what my Lord Byron the poet says, but when he wrote, "So, for a good old gentleman's fault, I think they put up with greed," I think she meant what she wrote, and if he practiced what he preached, not quarrel with him. As an occupation in the years down, I declare that saving is good, funny, and not ugly. It must be a perpetual amusement. It is a game that can be played by day, night, at home and abroad, and they need to win long term. I'm tired and want a taxi. Stay at my house, say, is two shillings. Cabman will naturally want half a crown. I take out my book. I show him the distance is just three miles and one thousand five hundred ninety and feet. I offer my book - my book of winning. As he retires with two shillings, blaspheming inside every curse is a compliment to my skill. I played him and beat him a sixpence is my prey and just reward. This is a game, incidentally, that women play more intelligent than us.
