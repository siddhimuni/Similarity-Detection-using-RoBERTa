had found it 60deg. in August, even at Boma during the dewy nights. The lowest temperature
of the water was 75deg., and the highest 79deg., whereas at the mouth it is sometimes 83deg.;
Tuckey gives 76deg.-77deg.; 74deg. in the upper river above the Falls, and 73deg. where there
are limestone springs. The oxydization of iron suddenly ceased; after a single day's drying,
the plants were ready for a journey to England, and meat which wrill hardly keep one day in
the lowlands is here eatable on the fifth.

Whilst the important subject of "dash" was being discussed I set out in my hammock to visit
a quitanda or market held hard by. As we started, the women sang,

          "Lungwa u telemene ko
           Mwanza Ko Yellala o kwenda."

"The boat that arrives at the Mwanza (the River) the same shall go up to the Yellala" (rapids).
It is part of a chant which the mothers of men now old taught them in childhood, and the sole
reminiscence of the Congo Expedition, whose double boats, the Ajojos of the Brazil, struck
their rude minds half a century ago.

These quitandas are attended by people living a dozen miles off, and they give names to the
days, which consequently everywhere vary. Thus at Boma Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday
are respectively called "Nkenge," "Sona," "Kandu," and "Konzo." This style of dividing time,
which is common throughout Pagan West Africa, is commonly styled a week: thus the Abbe Proyart
tells us that the Loango week consists of four days, and that on the fourth the men "rest"
by hunting and going to market. Tuckey also recognizes the "week of four days," opposed to
the seven days' week of the Gold Coast.

After half an hour's run to the north-west my bearers, raising loud shouts of "Alii! vai sempre!"
dashed into the market-place where about a hundred souls were assembled.
