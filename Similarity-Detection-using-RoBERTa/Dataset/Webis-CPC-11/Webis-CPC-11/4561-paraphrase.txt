Farmers took a few risks as possible to improve the land by taking leases of three, six and nine years. Farmers had to make up the waste that was caused by the previous tenant. Before the revolution, a farmer's holdings increased and the tradition of long leases came in. Therefore, monarchy was very common with farmers due to the concept of leases and land ownerships. 'will make republicans of them when you get them to let the forecastle elect the cook captain. That will not be to-morrow nor, I think, next week' is what was said about these practices. 

That night I left Calais for Boulogne. My friend that was also travelling to Picardy. I promised to accompany him later. When I reached the station, there was a huge crowd. I respected the good nature and will of the porters. The porters got as many passengers into the train as they could. They helped by asking passengers questions about where they wanted to go. These porters seemed very amiable and intelligent indeed.

When we were about to depart, a Persian journalist came into our apartment with a despatch box and his portmanteau. The journalist was wearing formal clothing that he had worn at the Presidential party. His cravat was white, loose and awry. He seemed to be in good spirits because he caught the train and would reach Paris early tommorrow morning. 

I asked him if the President was going to Boulogne.

He replied that the President would attend. I somehow knew what he was going to say that he will leave Bolougne early afternoon and that it would not be wise to spend much time in Boulogne.

The journalist had been with the President since the party had left paris and had thought that the progression was a success.
