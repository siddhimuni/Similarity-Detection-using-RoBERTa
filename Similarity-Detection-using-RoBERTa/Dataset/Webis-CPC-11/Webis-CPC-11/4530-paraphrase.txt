Who's to say that God cannot grant the power of thought to inanimate matter?  Even though we cannot state for sure that He has, we are certain that He COULD if He chose to do so! But what of the "thing" we call the soul?  Is it corporeal, as the  Fathers of the first Four Centuries thought, or simultaneously corporeal, formed and simple, as put forth by Tertullian?

All we know for sure is that we exist, we think, we feel.  We know that the body has a limited life on this earth, but what of the 'essence' of our thoughts and feelings?  Is the soul immortal?

What is the role of the Church in the quest to answer this "immortal" question?  Surely we must consider the incontrovertible dogmas of traditional religion and the revelation of spiritual discovery that follows.  One genuine revelation is worth a thousand philosophical arguments, on a personal level.

We need not have a comprehensive idea of every word we use.  For example, a common French phrase "soul of the bellows", as used in "the soul of the bellows has burst" refers to the redirection of compressed air from that towards the open hearth to another opening of the failed bellows valve.  Does the gardener who utters the phrase "soul of the plants" give any more thought to it than he is pleased by the fruits of his cultivation and labor?
