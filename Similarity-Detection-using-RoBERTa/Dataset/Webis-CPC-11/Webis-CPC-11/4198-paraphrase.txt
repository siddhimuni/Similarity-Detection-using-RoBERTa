They are all wrong. Getting my way on my way home. I feel extremely tired. However, it seems my duty to interfere in a street-line.

Thursday .-- Apparently we had an altercation with police last night. I am free, but painful. I really have to put me under arrest. I feel pretty sure that I gave way to alcoholism. In appealing to Brown (or whoever he is), he said I was as drunk as a fly for ages. This hurts me very much. The only thing to do is to retire to a retreat. They, with the assistance of Brown (or whoever he is), has compiled application. It seems quite right. And this is my last chance for some time to come, I and Brown (or whoever he is) are going to make a night of it.

Boots .-- Friday again! Brown (or whoever he is) called the two doctors. I said I could not be bothered by them. Brown (or whoever he is), I must say. So I saw. They say the law provides that I must understand what they do. All right - going into withdrawal. The word "withdrawal" should be pronounced as one syllable. Well, they did statutory declaration.

Saturday .-- Here I am. Nice place, away from drink, and ought to do well for the next two weeks. I can not remember how much I promised to stay, but I know it was for a considerable time. I saw only the inspector. He says he is very sorry, but I can not stand any more. This, despite it appearing to have signed a request to remain on life business. Can not make out. Vague about what I do during the week, but I wanted to heal me from inebriety usual. The inspector says I must turn under the statute. It seems that I signed the application for admission when I was not completely sober. can not be helped. I go out. Well, there are worse things in the world than the whiskey and port. I have reserved for a notion that another night in my boots!
