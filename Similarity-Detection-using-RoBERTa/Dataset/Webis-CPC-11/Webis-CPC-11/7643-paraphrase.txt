Other than the magnification, we know that the diminution is remarkable.

THE EVERLASTING ROMANCE

I did a perfectly dreadful thing the other day. I unconsiously intruded on a love scene in a very bludering way. It all took place in the National gallery, the famous meeting place of affinites, in the big room where the pictures lent by the Duke of WESTMINSTER and the Duke of BUCCLEUCH are hanging. Before I know it, I found myself standing between two young people fixing their eyes on one another. I naturally moved away from the private scene, but return to study them for a second because the romance was so passionate and deep that no one watching would effect them.
