RITA (from within): So...?

Whats wrong?

BERTHA (at the door): This gentlemen would like to see you. He will be passing by.

RITA (within; chuckles): Oh come in!

(Bertha enters.)

(Friedrich has walked up to the door in the middle, where he stands.) 

RITA: So. Who are you? Oh Friedrich.. I guess i will go see him now.

BERTHA (comes out and looks at Friedrich shockingly): Rita wishes to see you. (She leaves, after glancing back at the man.)

(Friedrich looks around in a fluster.)

(Rita enters in a nice dress, but does stays in the doorway.)

FRIEDRICH (bows; gently): Greetings.

(Rita does not talk, with a scoffing smile upon her face)

FRIEDRICH: Remember who i am?
