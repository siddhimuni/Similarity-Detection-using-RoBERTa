Chewing was temporarily halted the witth remarks of the Impayable, until we saw that he was again leaping out of his chair and dancing a crazy jig around the room. He was admirably agile, but the acrobatics ill-suited his solemn garments, and his clothes became terribly disarranged by his antics. He cried for water as he leapt about.

Oh dear! I have drunk from the vinegar bottle! Oh no! Bring me water, Lord, water! "No, no, sir, it was table wine, I assure you." "Water! water! oh -- thank you." "No, sir, that is Kirschen-wasser -- cherry schnapps --" "Any kind of water will do," and soon he had gulped down that fiery alcoholic beverage that looked so much like water at one gulp.

He struggled for breath -- he groaned in torment and writhed -- and soon he was taken by the others to his bed. As soon as he could, he popped up again from bed and went back to London as soon as possible, on the fastest and shortest road. He left with the fear of fire-water and vinegar burning in his eyes!

Encomium Moriae, or, Speaking well of Foolishness

A wise man once said that if you guard your gold coins in your purse when you go to market, you will come home with nothing. So too, if you never speak except to say someting witty, you will gain nothing from the exchange of conversation. 

Talking about unimportant things is just as crucial to the free flow of sociability as small, unimportant coins are to the market place. We cannot do without them. Each little remark that seems trivial on its own adds up to a rich conversation full of value.
