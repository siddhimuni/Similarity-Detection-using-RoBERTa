Nary a single stellar body may coruscate from the unfathomable pit of the night sky, for which Science cannot and will not reveal the amplitude of its light, and will not characterize its hushed and occult movements. Scalding swelters, earthquakes, tornados, contagion, icebergs, volcanoes--Science will take on all of them, to uncover yet another natural law. May God magnify the adventuresomeness of Science, if only her devotees will not supplant their adored demi-goddess for He who brought forth both the Concept and the subjects  of its contemplations. Science, when she has finally found the most fundamental and all-encompassing law of nature, has not probed the Deity Itself; she has only brushed the hem of the Supreme Legislator's robes.
  
One virtuoso of Science, Alexander von Humboldt, has acceded to the grand humanitarian law, as unyielding as any that he has come upon in his studies of Nature.
