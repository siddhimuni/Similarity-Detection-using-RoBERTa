You told me about it, "he insisted." Surely you remember? "

"I remember the conversation. I did not explain what I mean as a teacher shows a standard of higher mathematics, but I thought it might help to understand well enough, especially a vain thing as you."

"I, nothing? Oh!"

"You are, right?"

"I - well, I'm afraid, a little."

"I never would have looked in the mirror if they were not. Do not you see, or guess, I was talking about an ideal that I had conjured into being, as a desirable partner in that garden?" I can not see how the conversation ran, how it could have helped it. When I first went to the garden crenellated was several years younger, imbued with the spirit of Provence and full of thoughts of Nicolet. He was very sentimental to imagine that a girl like me there was Nicolet , and always after me the vision of the ideal associated with the garden. I told myself that I would go there again with that ideal in the flesh. And then - then came again - with you. "

"But you said - you thought of her always - that because he could not have - or something -"

"Well, everything that was not a surprise for you, right? You must have known very well - since that night in Avignon when you let your hair down, anyway, if not before, that I was trying hard not to be an idiot to you - and not radiant with joy think that whatever the man who would, not could I be? "

"Oh-oh!" I breathed a long breath heaven, which seemed to leave all the cares and worries out of my heart, like the air out my lungs. "Oh-oh, no one can say, really and truly, he loves me, right?"

"It is certainly not new to you."

"I think it was! "He exclaimed with enthusiasm." Oh, I'm so happy! "

"Another scalp - even a humble?"

Do not be a beast. I'm so terribly in love with you, you know. It's been so terribly hurt. "
