Eight-hour measures for employees in mines were enacted in Nevada, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho, California and Arizona. However in these Southern States there was not a similar accomplishment regarding children. (1)

The Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics prepared an admirable study concerning the labor-injunction question. This work was published in December, 1909. In this investigation eleven years are covered, ranging from 1898 to 1908. During this time frame two thousand and two strikes occurred. In sixty-six of the strikes the employers sought injunctions and in forty-six cases they were able to get injunctions issued. In nine cases there were proceedings for contempt of these injunctions, and in two cases there were convictions for contempt of court. In eighteen cases there were sought injunctions to prevent employees from striking. However, only in four of these they were granted. Even more, one of these was later dissolved. Employeed brought seven bills against unions for interference with their emplyment.In thre cases injunctions were sought by some unions against other unions. In one case a union brought a bill against an employer. In another case an employer sought an injunction against an employer's association. The Massachusetts Supreme Court declared unlawful for a trade-union to impose fines upon those of its members who refused to obey its orders to strike or engage in a boycott.
