Mark how the animal seizes
his glass,--by heavens he will break it into a thousand fragments! See how he bows his lubberly
head to meet half way the glorious cargo; how he slobbers the beverage over his unmeaning gullet,
and chucks down the glass so as almost to break its stem after he has emptied it of its contents
as if they had been jalap or castor-oil! Call you that taking a glass of wine? Sir, it is putting
wine into your gullet as you would put small beer into a barrel,--but it is not--oh, no! it
is not taking, so as to enjoy, a glass of red, rich port, or glowing, warm, tinted, beautiful
caveza!

A newly married couple are invited to a wedding dinner. Though the lady, perhaps, has run off
with a person below her in rank and station, see when they enter the room, how differently
they behave.--How gracefully she waves her head in the fine recover from the withdrawing curtsy,
and beautifully extends her hand to the bald-pated individual grinning to her on the rug! While
the poor spoon, her husband, looks on, with the white of his eyes turned up as if he were sea-sick,
and his hands dangle dangle on his thighs as if he were trying to lift his own legs. See how
he ducks to the lady of the house, and simpers across the fire-place to his wife, who, by this
time is giving a most spirited account of the state of the roads, and the civility of the postilions
near the Borders.

Is a man little? Let him always, if possible, stoop. We are sometimes tempted to lay sprawling
in the mud fellows of from five feet to five feet eight, who carry the back of their heads
on the extreme summit of their back-bone, and gape up to heaven as if they scorned the very
ground. Let no little man wear iron heels. When we visit a friend of ours in Queen-street we
are disturbed from our labours or conversation by a sound which resembles the well-timed marching
of a file of infantry or a troop of dismounted dragoons.
