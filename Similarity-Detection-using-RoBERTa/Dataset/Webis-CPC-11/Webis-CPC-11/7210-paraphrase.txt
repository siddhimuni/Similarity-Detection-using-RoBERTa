Civil War and Commonwealth is a sub-heading of No. 30--History; but among book-collectors it is a subject of intrest, volumes issued during this period are sui generis and most of them are of interest.

With the end of the Star Chamber around 1641 and with the sudden decrease in number of printers, the presses started to put forth political tracts and books of various kinds. It goes without saying that a large sum of books thus issued were nameless publications. Although two years further an Order for the Regulating laws of Printing, and Cromwell's censorship were applied by an Act in 1649. A large amount of printed political material continued throughout the time, to make its appearance on the book stalls of the shops. What would Cromwell not have done to stop 'Killing no Murder'! Edwards' 'Catalogue of the Great Rebellion Tracts in the British Museum' from being included in his 'Memoirs of Libraries,' which appeared in 1859. George Thomason's glorious sum of Royalist tracts will be put under the heading 'Pamphlets.'

Among all the elements of our list perhaps none contains greater beauty and printed with greater uniqueness than--the Classics of the Old World. It is a rarity for the scholar to-day, The time when no library was thought of as complete without most of the old masters of Greece and Italy is long past; and there remains not the competition these days to acquire the well-known volumes which would adorn the shelves of our grandfathers. Just recently our book-hunter saw a sixteenth-century folio Isocrates, bound in ancient green morocco, for seven and sixpence; such is evident in a modern bookseller catalogue today.
