Back to Venice! A particularly early fourteenth, possibly, thirteenth century superb tomb is an impeccable example of Gothic architecture. This tomb is located Westward the Church of Frari, second chapel to the left. This unmarked crypt reflects the belonging of a mysterious knight. An arched awning upholds the knight's crest while a deep blue and starry scene fills the underlying space.The sarcophagus is mounted with gallant brackets upon the chapel wall. From a distance the stuate is crudely carved, yet gentley from gifted work. Laid in his mail, only the knights hands and face are visible. Made of chain-mail are the hauberk and helemt. The limbs are armoured with jointed steel. Marked by two sewn arrows, the tunic lies close to the breast embellishing dignity. A dagger at his right; his extensive sword at his left, hidden from observers. Peering towards the master from underneath his feet is a hound, as his crest. Generally, faces of tombs of this stature should be slighty presented towards the viewer. However, this statue's face is opposite the spectator and instead gazing upward at a small carved image of St. Joseph holding the infant Christ who is staring back down at the knight.
