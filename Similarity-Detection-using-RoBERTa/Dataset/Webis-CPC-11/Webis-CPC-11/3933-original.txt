The master spirits in unbelief give abundant evidence of their ignorance
of the scriptures of the Bible. Not one in a thousand ever investigated the scriptures of the
Bible with pure and honest motives. Many have never investigated it at all. To read a chapter
here and there for the sole purpose of finding fault and getting up a difficulty, is not investigation.
An honest investigation requires a very different course. All the evidence must be brought
into the court and presented in such a manner as to be understood, just as it was given, otherwise
the court is not qualified to decide righteously in the case. That all such men as Col. Ingersoll
have failed to thus investigate the Bible is evident from the fact that they, to be like him,
must be infidels in all their history. It is published to the world that the Colonel was born
an infidel. He has been hacking away at religion and the Bible ever since he was a small boy.
So his infidelity is not the result of an intelligent investigation of either science or religion.
I will not undertake to say what the Colonel's trouble is, but if he was born an infidel it
is possible, according to our law, that he will die an unbeliever.

Many infidels, governed by a spirit of fanaticism, undoubtedly, have labored with as much earnestness
as if the world's salvation depended upon their efforts, without the least hope of bettering
its condition, for the false philosophy of materialism which they advocate gives to a man nothing
to live for except his own animal nature. This philosophy says all is well as long as you dodge
the sharp corners of the laws of your country. If the materialist can avoid paying fines, along
with all other penalties of the laws of his country, what need he care for one course of life
in preference to another? Do you say he has a conscience? Well, it may be that it is not seared
so that he is past feeling. Very few men, I know, ever reach such a depraved condition.
