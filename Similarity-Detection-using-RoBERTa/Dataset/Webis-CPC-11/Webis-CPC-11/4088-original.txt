They delay
not; they raise the royal maiden from the stream; they bear her unto the chamber of her brother
for her obsequies; and, according to the superstition of the pagans, the tombs are prepared.
And a rumor gathers in the palace that he, Patrick of Ardmachia, who in the name of the unknown
God had already raised many that were even dead, had on that day arrived in the city.  This
the king hearing rejoiced mightily; and he caused him to come where his two children lay, and,
being already full of faith, he promised that if God at the prayers of the saint would restore
the children of his age, he and all his people would worship him.  And all the nobles confirm
the promise of the king, and the whole city yearneth toward the faith, so that the children
may but be revived.  Then the saint, beholding the gain of souls which was there prepared for
him, poured forth his prayers, and in the sight of the king and of the people restored to life
the royal children; and they, being made the assistants unto the faith, rising again in their
bodies, assisted in their father and in the people the resurrection of souls.  And this king
was called Alphinus, and his son was called Cochadh, and his daughter Dublinia, and from her
the city received its name.  And he and all his people, rejecting their idols and all the abominations
of the devils, were converted unto Christ, and were baptized at the fountain of Saint Patrick,
at the southern side of the city, which the saint, striking the earth with the staff of Jesus,
had caused to arise, to the increase of the faith of the believers; wherefore did the saint
offer there the sacrifice unto salvation; and there, even to this day, is honor and reverence
paid Saint Patrick and his successors, the primates of Ardmachia.  And from that time the King
Alphinus and all the citizens of Dublinia vowed themselves and all their posterity to the service
of Saint Patrick and the primates of Ardmachia, and builded one church near this fountain,
and another near the Church of the Holy Trinity, and in the city westward of the archbishop's
palace.
