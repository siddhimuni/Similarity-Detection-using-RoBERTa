So it's natural to be bored with all three. Then came on the scene a Ruddiger Judith, a widow, with red lips, driving a big car with abandon tourism, men played golf and generally called in Frensham to basics, what d'you-call - 'ems. So these two decided to dive into the freer life of the drain process. I was a little disappointed here. There has been much talk about the great things that I had expected a much wider environment of his adventure in Monte Carlo, followed by a round of first class hotels. Judith moreover, had a way of dealing with your partner as "partner", which highlighted his personality Wild West to a degree that must have been almost painful in the winter season of sports, "full of school teachers . So it was almost no surprise when Frensham soon grew more bored than ever. Meanwhile, the wife of worship (whom the author has outlined very nice and well) had refused to divorce him, and so, in the long term - well, you can see from the principle that long-term intended to finish. But you probably do not like a nice story, except for this. Mr. Deeping certainly has value. There is a scene or two in which it takes its Amazon Judith to the edge of banality. "I could shoot straight with a pistol, and he demonstrated by bringing a gun to the summer house, and taking Frensham hang your hat on the guideway that ran along the wood." Rough to court dramatists shy! I could not resist imagining how the late Mr. PELISSIER would have handled this situation.

I wonder if EVELYN PETTER BRAXSCOMBE just decided that his novel could not be a day without a German spy and so on, or if she really prepared to do their bit for the war, commenting on the Teutonic idea of honor.

Anyway, you have to admit that his Gretchen Meyer draws quite rare ability, even if their mental processes are not exactly underground clarified in the disclosure of Ms. Velanty (Chapman and Hall). Although educated in England and dependent for their misfortune, the friends of English for maintenance, always hiding in the attitude of selfishness Gretchen impartial hostility deaf to the ways of this country, and particularly to a nasty habit found us to make an exaggerated value on direct business.

This culminated in a free lot, and in fact even insane, to claim the man who for his sins he loved her he must give up his ideal either English or her. What he did so wisely and honestly let it go and be d ---- d to it, for my part, I had no doubt, nor do I think was the author, because, although he could never forget that Gretchen was her heroine, giving her a sort of beauty, and even openly labeling attractive, really, in general, a person intentionally repulsive presented to us.

Despite an interesting study in perfidy Teutonic and certainly better written newspaper columns later, I can hardly recommend the book as a refreshing change that kind of literature.

Mr. HB MARRIOTT WATSON has invented a gentleman of the road, Dick Ryder, of which his publishers, Methuen, say they are very proud of that so nice that they have.

Armed with a punch and a charlatan who rushes and fangs in their path through life, cutting and bending weasands each Cully muckworm is a nice current language (which takes faith) at the time of our second JAMES . Should have been more impressed with the exploits of this hero of the early stories As if by chance if they had been in the slightest degree very plausible. Surely never was such absurd arguments, in which the action is quite a score of opponents desperate suspended while the fearsome acrobatics brings out superb. I remember once grateful to have been helped by a dull day for La Casa de las Dunas. Unless the unions memory I think the author makes some reasonable amount of invention in it. But these stories are quite indifferent collected boiling pot if you are taking any other standard, but the formula of the gallery for the adventure yarn. Maybe, "casually," my lunch war did not agree with me. But anyway I really honestly I can not commend this book to any fan of the majority of the many loyal friends MARRIOTT Mr. Watson.
