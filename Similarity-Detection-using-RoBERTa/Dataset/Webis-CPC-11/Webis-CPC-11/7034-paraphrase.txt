This feeling was found equally in Homer and in Wordsworth.  Actually most poets in most nations and eras have experienced this at least once.  Why then is there this divergence of opinion?

We could think a bit further.

We could talk about melancholy's mythological beginnings and say that some talk of the bird who's fallen against thorn and had its breast pierced.

That activates the inner pain and makes its music so melancholy.

However, we should be honest enough to say that we could challenge Virgil and Thomson (treated here as one entity) because the one who wrote the Seasons in the lines we look at has made a loose (not as careful as Dryden) translation from the Latin poet's Georgics.

Whether you read the passage through Virgil, Dryden, or Thomson, you'll see that here the nightingale's normal song is not referred to and what is referred to is a special occurrence.
Thomson as he protests about the barbarous art says:

this is the way birds are captured by tyrannical humans and kept in a small cage.  They're kept from freedom and from breathing deeply of the air

is really talking about the bereaved nightingale.

We'll keep this section of writing as a whole and not mangle them further:

But don't let the nightingale bemoan her condition in which she has too delicate a constitution to stand the caged life.

It often happens that the mother comes back with food for her babies and finds an empty nest because they've been snatched by thieves; and so she lets the food fall to the ground, uneaten.
