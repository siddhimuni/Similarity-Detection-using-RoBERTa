His only hope for later fame was to increase saless of his poems to the lower class.  He thought he had sometimes succeeded in doing  this.  Many people had told him how much reading "Michael" and his other works had affected them.  I concurred, saying that my emotions would overcome me each time I read it.  His poem about his wife showed tender regard, sweetness, admiration, and respect--but also reserve and delicacy.  He felt bad that my uncle had written so little poetry because he thought him very qualified due to his good ear, skill with meter, and his wonderful and happy way of expressing himself.  He said that he wrote so little because he took such great time and effort in developing his meter.  When he would experiment with a new meter, he put impossible amounts of time and labor into the writing.  He was an epicure as far as sound goes.  Later he came to believe that he had damaged his poetical powers and lost his delight in nature from analysing his feelings so much instead of just enjoying them.  He claimed that he did not know how to finish "Christabelle," and his didn't think my unccle had ever come up with a plan for it.  He said he had composed the poem when they talked daily, practically during the times they were together.  Furthermore, they communicated freely concerning all their literary projets and productions, and he had never heard him say a word about his plan to finish the poem.  He never doubted my uncle's later assertions to the contrary; rather, he said that ideas of this type went through his mind so rapidly and so vividly and impressed him so much that he imagined he had actually arranged things that he had barely thought about or worked on.
