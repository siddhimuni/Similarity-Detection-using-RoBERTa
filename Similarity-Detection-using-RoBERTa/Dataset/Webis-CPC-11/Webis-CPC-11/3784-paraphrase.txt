The Adepts' supernatural power need to be proven to be true with some evidence. This higher order way of teaching is not based on concrete proof of any kind and is thus unsustainable. Unlike any scientific experiment ,as in Chemistry, which is about documenting reliable records or reports during scientific observation to prove a hypothesis (that leads to a conclusion); the Adepts teaching is groundless. Western science is based on evidence gathered from relentless experimentations. Then the new finding or invention is released to the outside world. Supporters of the Adepts seem to have a blind faith of their leaders' power and will not even demand proof of any miracle performed by them.

We are glad of the Adepts' choice of Mr. Sinnett as the go-between or middleman between us. He is aware of how westerners think. He has a clear writing style, a modern way of speech and is sincere about his comments and views. We are appreciative of their consideration in picking Mr. Sinnett to interpret for us. As a further consideration, we would like them to adapt and modify their teaching to meet the needs of the Occidental thought method.
