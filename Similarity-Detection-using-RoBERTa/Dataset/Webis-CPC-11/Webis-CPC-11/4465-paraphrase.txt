Genius may shoot up in a land quite inhospitable to it; it may perhaps even blossom in the most ungenial season. But the rose-bush that displays its blushing honours in the face of the surly uncomfortable east wind, must have sprung from a root of no small vigour. In a certain island, the fostering indulgences and kind attention which the narcissus, the gilly flower, the tuberose', the Cape jessamiii, and all the delicate flowers that adorn the garden, deserve and require ; are mostabsufdly and perniciously bestowed upon ragwort, jack of the hedge, priest's what d'ye call it, bilhops weed, bear's foot, nightshade, and henbane.' The Tafe of the present Age. 

• Amongst many other distinguishing marks of a stupid age, a bad crop of men, I have been told that the taste in writing was never so false as at present. If it is really so, it may perhaps be owing to a prodigious swarm of insipid trashy writers : amongst whom there are some who pretend to dictate to the public as critics, though they hardly ever fail to be mistaken. But their dogmatic impudence, and something like a scientific air of talking the most palpable nonsense, imposes upon great numbers of people, who really possess a considerable share of natural Taste ; of which at the same time they are so little conscious as to suffer themselves passively to be misted by those blundering guides.

♦ A Taste worth cultivating is to be improved and preserved by reading only the best writers. But whoever, after perusing a satire of Horace, even in the dullest English translation, can relish the stupid abuse of a blackguard rhymfter, may as welj indulge the natural depravity of his Taste, and riot for life upon distiller's grains.
