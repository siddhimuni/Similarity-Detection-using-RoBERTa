Yet as far as the law goes, it is not a fact, and on both sides the Channel it is the same. By law, the Irish landlord can only eject a lease-holding tenant after a year's rent is owing. Even then, tenant is allowed six months for redemption. The landlord can only distrain after the rent becomes due. He can evict a tenant at will by providing six months notice (to expire on or before commencement of tenancy), and only then can he eject him if the tenant refuses to give up possession. 

By law, the English landlord has the same powers and legislatively landlords in both countries are in the same precise position. However, the English proprietor has options the Irish one dare not attempt. No one blames him if he enforces his covenants to stop fences from being torn down on the estate or hedge-rows and trees from being trimmed, or prevents damage to the land from bad husbandry or leaving it useless by planting a succession of the same crop.

The Irish landlord may put rigid clauses in his leases; but he lacks the power their enforcement would give him. He is restrained by public opinion, which always favours the delinquent, and fear of the assassin. 

The farm the late Mr Hall let out was a fine one, but the tenant tore up the land, burned it and set it in con-acre, all contrary to his agreements. The unfortunate Mr. Hall attempted to prevent violation of the engagements by going to ground and threatening to enforce his covenant. As a result, he was murdered in broad daylight and in the presence of witnesses, while his assassins quietly walked away free. They were only brought to justice when a large reward tempted one of the hired murderers to peach on his accomplices.

In Ireland there is an act of Parliament in force that imposes heavy penalties to prevent burning of land; yet this mischievous practice cannot be stopped--why?
