Its a publication inits altered from in 1773 had the effect of a bomb on the literary public of Germany. It sent a shudder of horror through the stickers for the rules of the classical drama which it ignored with such contemptous indefference; a shudder of delight through the band of effervscing youths who Gotz was a manifesto and a challenge to all traditional conventions in literature and growth--the literature of Sturm und Drang, whose exponents, says Kant, thought that they could not more effectively show that they were budding geniuses than by finging all rules to the winds, and that one on a trained steed. The literature of Strum und Drang was a pssing phenomenon, but the influence of Gotz did not end with its abortive life. But for gotz Schiller's early productions would have been differently inspired; and to Gotz also was due much of the inspiration of the subsequent German Romantic School, through many, of its developements were abhorrent to Goethe's nature both in youth and maturity. It emancipated the drama from conventional shackles. but it did more: it extended the range of national throught, sentiment, and emotion, and for good and evil introduced new elements into German literature which have maintained their place there since its first portentous apperance. And german critics are unanimous in assigning another result to the publication of Gotz: in its style as in its form it set convention at naught, and thus marks an epoch in the developement of German literary language. Not since Luther, "whose words were battles", had German been written so direct from the heart and with such elemental force as makes words living things.

It has been a commonplace remark that 1773, the year of the publication of Gotz, corresponds in European literature to 1789 in European political history
