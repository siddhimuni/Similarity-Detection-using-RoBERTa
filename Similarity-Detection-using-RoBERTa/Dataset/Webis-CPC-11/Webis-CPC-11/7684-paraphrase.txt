When it comes to a fascinating aristocrat such as the Duke of Norfolk, he is as quick to comment as the gentleman he addresses:"The Man occupied that collection of politicians which believes that there are no circumstances meriting a sense of satisfaction or contentment; who scheme and contravene without pause; who are constantly sticking their neck out courageously, admittedly, but imprudently, and thereby courting decapitation." This abstruse analytical skill shows through in all parts of the book. Illustrating the avidity of Londoners for Henry of Bolingbroke, and their dispassion for the subjugated King Richard, the historian sharply notes: "Forever, since the origin of the world, have those who have fallen from high grace and authority been demeaned. The majority of these happen after an effective overthrowing, but at no time does it provide a protection to fallen nobility."
