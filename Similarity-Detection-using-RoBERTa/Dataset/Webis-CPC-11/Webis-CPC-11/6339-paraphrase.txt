Mexicans are divided over the country hot temperate zones, land and Frias, according to the weather. Throughout the country there is a lamentable lack of water and navigable rivers. The lakes also appear to be declining in one-year extension, the immediate consequence is that the upper parts of the interior are almost devoid of vegetation and soil covered with a flower of carbonate of soda, is called Tequisquita, closely resembles the plains of Castilla la Nueva, and reminding travelers of this desolate waste in parts of Persia. 
The effect of temperature increase is more pronounced, and it is rare that trembles on one side of the street in Mexico City, and be literally burned by the sun's rays on the other.

Mulattoes, descendants of whites and blacks. 5. Zambos, Indians and blacks. 6. Pura Indians. 7. Black Africans. But this classification can be reduced to four: - 1. Whites. 2. The Indians. 3. Blacks. 4. Mixed breeds, the various gradations of which can be considered almost infinite. 

The Indians made up a considerable number of different tribes, which differ in many aspects of appearance, and talk - not dialects, but - completely different languages. No less than twenty of them have been located, and fourteen of them are the grammars and dictionaries. The indigenous population is concentrated mainly in the Great Plains, and south, and Humboldt thinks that has flowed from north to south. The story of four large-scale migration is preserved in the annals of Mexico, which deserve a closer look at what we can about them.

This credit reduces the phlegmatic temperament of men to women, who prefer the European standard, black or even more lively. "Indigenous Mexicans serious, melancholy, silent, if not under the influence of intoxicants.
