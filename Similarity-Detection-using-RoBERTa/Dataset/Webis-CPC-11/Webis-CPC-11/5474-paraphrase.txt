The longest tunnels in the country run under the range of hills between Marsden in Yorkshire and Diggle in Lancashire, two being for railway and one canal use. One of the former is 5,434 yards, and the other (Stanedge, on the L. & N.W.) 5,435 yards long, while the canal tunnel is 5,451 yards.                                                According to Turnpike Gates At one time there were gates or bars on nearly every road out of the town. Even at the bottom of Worcester Street there was a bar across the road in 1818. There was once a gate at the junction of Hang'sman Lane (our Great Hampton Row) and Constitution Hill, which, baing shifted further on, to about the spot where Green and Cadbury's Works now are, remained till 1839. The gate in Deritend was removed in August, 1828; the one at Five Ways July 5, 1841; those at Small Heath, at Sparkbrook, in the Moseley Road, and in the Hagley Road were all "free'd" in 1851, and the sites of the toll houses sold in 1853.                                                 According to Union Passage at first but a field path out of the yard of the Crown Tavern to the Cherry Orchard, afterwards a narrow entry as far as Crooked Lane, with a house only at each end, was opened up and widened in 1823 by Mr. Jones, who built the Pantechnetheca. Near the Ball Street end was the Old Bear Yard, the premises of a dealer in dogs, rabbits, pigeons, and other pets, who kept a big brown bear,                                    According to  Vauxhall  The old place, having been purchased by the Victoria Land Society, was closed by a farewell dinner and ball, September, 16, 1850, the first stroke of the axe to the trees being given at the finish of the ball, 6 a.m. next morning.          According to Vaughton's Hole An unfortunate soldier fell into a deep clay pit here, in July, 1857, and was drowned; and about a month after (August 6) a horse and cart, laden with street sweepings, was backed too near the edge, over-turned, and sank to the bottom of sixty feet deep of water. The place was named after a very old local family who owned considerable property in the neighbourhood of Gooch Street, &c., though the descendants are known as Houghtons.
