Weyburn left the message with Dr. Rewkes in person.  It had not seemed to him that Lord Ormont
was one requiring the immediate attendance of a physician.  By way of accounting to Lady Charlotte
for the lateness of his call, he mentioned the summons he had delivered.

'Oh, that's why he hasn't come yet,' said she.  'We'll sit and talk till he does come.  I don't
wonder if his bile has been stirred.  He can't oil me to credit what he pumps into others.
His Lady Ormont!  I believe in it less than ever I did.  Morsfield or no Morsfield--and now
the poor wretch has got himself pinned to the plank, like my grandson Bobby's dragonflies,
I don't want to say anything further of him--she doesn't have much of a welcome at Steignton!
