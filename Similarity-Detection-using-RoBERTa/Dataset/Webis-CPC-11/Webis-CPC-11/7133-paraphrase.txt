For several generations, France has had a government unruled by any expression of organized public opinion. It had been so long since the idea of such a government had been brought up that the details of such an establishment had passed out of living memory and could barely be found again. However, in the end, the authority and precedent were ascertained, and the States-General (made up of the Church, the Nobility, and the People) met at Versailles for the purpose of dealing with the country's financial difficulties. Soon it became clear that the majority of the States-General intended to accomplish much more than that. The news travelling from the capital of France grew much more interesting and important, and this trend continued steadily for more than a quarter of a century.

Things progressed quickly. The members of the Third Estate cut themselves off from the Church and Nobility to meet in the Tennis Court in Versailles, declaring themselves a National Assembly. The agitated people of Paris, who feared that the king would suppress the Assembly by force, broke out into riots, which culminated in an attack upon the Bastille prison in Faubourg St. Antoine. The Bastille had not been a serious instrument of oppression for many years, but it had an evil record, and for many was a representation of everything they detested about the old order.

The Bastille was captured, it's few prisoners were borne triumphantly through the streets, and it's commander, De Launay, was decapitated. His head was carried about the city on the point of a pike.
