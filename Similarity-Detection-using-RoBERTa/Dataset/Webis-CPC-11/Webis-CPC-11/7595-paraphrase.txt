You are a miserable, poor fellow prisoner. Pollio wise. Think of the glory of their ancestors and throw aside the miserable obstacle that keeps you away from your illustrious reputation. " 
"I can not." 

"You have lived a miserable outcast. The poorest beggar in Rome fares better than you. Their food is obtained with less work and less humiliation. His home is in the light of day. On top of all that is safe . Your life is yours. He has to live with fear when justice. But you had to drag out a miserable existence in poverty and danger and darkness. 

Whatever your religion boasted given? 

What does this Jew deified done for you? Nothing worse than nothing. Well then, this impostor. Wealth and comfort, friends and state honors and the emperor's favor, all will be yours. " 

"I can not." 

"His father was a loyal subject and a brave soldier. He died in the battle for their country. He left a baby, the heir of all his honors, and the last pillar of his house. 

Little did he think of the dangerous influences surrounding the drift. mind of his mother, weakened by pain, surrendered to the insidious wiles of false teachers, and once again ruin wrought by ignorance. 

He had his noble father was now living would have been the hope of his ancient lineage, his mother would have followed the faith of their illustrious ancestors. 

Do you have the memory of your father? Has any demand in filial duty? You think there's plenty of shame sin in the proud name you bear and throw ugly stain on the reputation immaculate transmitted to you from your father? 

Stop this illusion that blinds you. For the memory of your father, for the honor of his family, also his present course. " 

"I can do no dishonor. My religion is pure and holy. 

I can die, but I can not be false to my Savior. " 

"You see who are merciful to you. His name and his lack of experience excites our compassion. Was it you, but a common prisoner briefly offer the choice between the retraction or death. 

But we are willing to reason with you, so you do not want to see a noble family was extinguished by ignorance or obstinacy of a degenerate heir. " 

"I thank you for your consideration," Pollio said, "but his arguments have no weight with me next to the highest demands of my religion. " 

"Rash and unconscious child! 

There is another argument that is more powerful.

The emperor's anger is terrible. " 

"But even more terrible is the wrath of the Lamb." 

"You speak an unintelligible language. 

What is the wrath of the Lamb? Do not believe what's in front of you. " 

"My colleagues and friends have endured all that can inflict. I hope I can have the strength." 

"Can you endure the terrors of the sand?" 

"I have more than deadly force." 

"Can the face of wild lions and tigers, which then precipitated on you?" 

"One in whom I trust I gave in my time of need."

"You're safe." 

"I trust in Him who loved me and gave Himself for me." 

"Have you thought about death by fire? Are you ready to respond to flames at the stake?" 

"Ay! If I have to bear that will not be reduced. In the worst that will soon end, and then it will always be with the Lord." 

"The fanaticism and superstition have taken complete possession of you. Do not know what to expect. It is easy to deal with threats, it is easy to pronounce words and make profession of value. But how will be with you when the reality is you scared? " 

"I'll get one who never leaves his own in his hour of need." 

"He has not done anything to you until now!" 

"He has done everything for me. He gave his life for me to live. Through him I received a noble life that take you from me." 

"This is not a dream of yours. How can a miserable Jew can do this." 

"It was the fullness of the Godhead. God in the flesh of the body was put to death could receive life for the soul." 

"And do not open your eyes? Is not it enough that so far his crazy belief has brought nothing but misery and misfortune? Should you still cling to it? When you see that death is inevitable not to turn away from your mistakes ?

"He gives me strength to conquer death, I'm afraid not.
