It is peculiar province, for example, by a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these are contracts that, although there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, sufficient to invalidate a court of law, yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of a party, a court of equity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were concerned on either side, it would be impossible for federal judicatories do justice without an equitable and jurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under grants of different states, may provide another example of the need for equitable jurisdiction in federal courts. This reasoning can not be so palpable in those states where formal and technical distinction between law and equity is not maintained, as in this state, where it is exemplified in daily practice.

Judicial authority of the Union is to expand:

Second. To make treaties, or to be carried out under the authority of the United States and to all cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and other public authorities and consuls. They belong to the class of fourth cases listed, because they have a clear link with the national peace.

Thirdly. For cases of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. They form together the fifth class listed in appropriate cases the courts attention.

Fourth. To controversies to which the United States must be a party. This is the third of these classes.

Fifth. To controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another State, between citizens of different states. They are the fourth of these classes and take part in some extent, the nature of the past.

Sixth. To cases between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different states.
