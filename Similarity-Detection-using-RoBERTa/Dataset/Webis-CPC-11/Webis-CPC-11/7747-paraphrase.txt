Southerly winds begin in April, bringing with theme the wet season, heavy storms, including thunder, lightning, and even tornadoes.  By September, the winds begin to come from east-north-east, bringing clear weather.  I have observed this change of wind at other sites, but the change of weather that comes with it is particular to this location of Bahia.  It is unlike other locations I have observed in the tropics at similar latitudes.  In those latitudes, the dry season begins in April, and the wet season begins in October or November, rather than the wet season in April and fairer weather in September.  The seasons are reversed, from the Northern latitudes to the Southern latitudes of Brazil, and the rainy season is a month shorter.  When the fairer weather comes, they can begin to cut their sugarcane here.  I confirmed that the cutting of sugarcane begins in September here, which conflicts with what I had been told before, that the sugar can cutting began in July.
