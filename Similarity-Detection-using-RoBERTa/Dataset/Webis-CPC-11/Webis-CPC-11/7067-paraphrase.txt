The view is, therefore, forced to abandon the feelings where they are, and the apprehension of them in what is, and to recognize the two as separate from the other - the feelings as separate from the body, they really are. So we explain the origin of the perception of distance, the eye, firmly believing that the hearing has not been seen this distance, without the mediation of touch. 
Reason to understand the reasoning above - in fact to advance a single step in the true philosophy of sensation - both cast off the prejudices instilled in us a false physiology, that what we call our body, or, in simple words, our body, is necessarily the seat of our feelings. That all our sensations become associated in some way with this body, and some of them even come to be associated with him in his place, is undeniable; but so far is true, they are all essentially implied or incorporated into it, and there can be at a distance from it, we have direct evidence to the contrary in our sensations of sight, and to the physiologist can prove (which has never been proven) an a priori necessity that our feelings should be where our bodies, and an absurd a priori, assuming otherwise, we should be an excuse for standing resolutely by the fact we found it. 

This is a view that does not allow much discussion, and we will gladly elaborate on the subject, did time and space permitting, but we must content ourselves with the liquidation of these observations with the following diagram, which we believe explains our view beyond the possibility of error.

The synthesis is original, or nondiscrimination of vision and their feelings - of light and colors.
