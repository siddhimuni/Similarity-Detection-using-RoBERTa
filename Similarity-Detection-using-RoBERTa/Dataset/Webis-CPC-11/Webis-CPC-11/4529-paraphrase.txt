Death  is not dreadful as it seems. This is because we feel that in heaven the friendship continues and 
ripens through never-ending cycles .The deeds in earth will be recognized and greeted there.
           But the way to  heaven is not easy to follow. 
     Even the most wonderful gifts of world are unsatisfactory. Rich are always after their wealth and busy in accumulating it. When they die thay are forgoten as their money is valued not their inner self. Comparing to the rich the poorer are happier than them. Consider life as only a pilgrimage. It is only a journey to the eternal life.  To avail the golden crown of  we have to suffer certain difficulties.
  Again the preacher says ofcourse, we are of earth, although we believe in the almighty and his blessings we are not able to forbid the happiness of the world. To a large number of christians eternity ,heaven and God are not a reality it is only a chimerical feeling in the atmosphere of faith which they are not able to understand. Hence they cannot acquire the true faith in God. 
       The real happiness lies in our heart. If we are ready to help others and  can do something for others  without expecting reward in the world we will be granted that gift by the Lord Almighty himself.
