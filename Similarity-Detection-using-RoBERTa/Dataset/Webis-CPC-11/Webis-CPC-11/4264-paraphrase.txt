Accumulating money.

There is no doubt that "hoarding" currency remains largely and greatly increases the shortage, and therefore the value of precious metals. Even the old practice of "making media" is not delivered in rural districts. Ourselves, but back a few days, saw an old hag, the wife of a small, poor farmers apparently in a wild pastoral district, brings at least three hundred sovereigns in a bag to a lawyer of neighbors , placed by him in safety: the treasure had accumulated was afraid to keep it more time at home. These examples are not quite as rare as you can imagine. The failures of many provincial banks in 1825 destroyed the confidence of rural people in the present bank notes, and the causes of your choice of gold. The fact that many lawyers and banks in countries that were received and deposit interest, and (with the exception of the savings banks, which are very limited in the amount of deposits that allow) the absence total, in the rural districts of England, of any repositories safe and accessible for the savings of economic variables, such as the invaluable Scottish banks have tended to discourage more damaging the economy, and when the principle was grafted hard, have become a practice of hoarding - have made to pool in the mass unprofitable spread through proper channels, which have stimulated new industries and new collections, adding both to the owner's wealth, and general values .-- Ibid.
