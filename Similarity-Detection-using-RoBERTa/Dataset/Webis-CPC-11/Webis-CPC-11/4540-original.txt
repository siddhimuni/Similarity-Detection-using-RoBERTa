These,
with a free mariner, and no inconsiderable sprinkling of writers, cadets, and assistant-surgeons,
together with the officers of the ship, who dined at the captain's table, formed a party of
about twenty-five.--Twelve Years' Military Adventure.

EDUCATION IN DENMARK.

Much pains has lately been taken in Denmark to promote the means of elementary education, and
Lancasterian schools have been generally established throughout the country. We have now before
us the Report made to the king by the Chevalier Abrahamson, of the progress, prospects, and
present state of the schools for mutual instruction in Denmark, to the 28th of January, 1828,
by which it appears, that 2,371 schools for mutual instruction have been established, and are
in full progress, in the different districts of the kingdom and in the army.--North American
Review.

RECORDS.

Some faint idea of the bulk of our English records may be obtained, by adverting to the fact,
that a single statute, the Land Tax Commissioners' Act, passed in the first year of the reign
of his present majesty, measures, when unrolled, upwards of nine hundred feet, or nearly twice
the length of St. Paul's Cathedral within the walls; and if it ever should become necessary
to consult the fearful volume, an able-bodied man must be employed during three hours in coiling
and uncoiling its monstrous folds. Should our law manufactory go on at this rate, and we do
not anticipate any interruption in its progress, we may soon be able to belt the round globe
with parchment. When, to the solemn acts of legislature, we add the showers of petitions, which
lie (and in more senses than one) upon the table, every night of the session; the bills, which,
at the end of every term, are piled in stacks, under the parental custody of our good friends,
the Six Clerks in Chancery; and the innumerable membranes, which, at every hour of the day,
are transmitted to the gloomy dens and recesses of the different courts of common-law and of
criminal jurisdiction throughout the kingdom, we are afraid that there are many who may think
that the time is fast approaching for performing the operation which Hugh Peters recommended
as "A good work for a good Magistrate."
