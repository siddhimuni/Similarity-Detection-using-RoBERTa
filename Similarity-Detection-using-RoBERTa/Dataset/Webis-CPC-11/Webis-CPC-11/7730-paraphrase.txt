At the time, in that sweet-aired, Spring-ambianced cottage thou didst apply thy stocking unto thy exquisite limb, I spied a star in the void of the turret. Much Plato have I read, very little of which I remember; alas, more effectively than Malebranche or Lamennais didst thou reveal unto me cosmic beneficence with only a blossom which you made a gift to me, I acquiesced to thee, and thou didst resign thyself to me; oh, golden turret! to intertwine thee! to feast mine eyes upon thee making thy way in the morning light in thy camisole, admiring thy youthful countenance in thine timeworn looking glass! And, who, then, would foresake the memory of those days of eos and empyrean, of flora, of gauze and of silk, when infatuation quavers an enchanting patois? Our palatial gardens amounted to a jardiniere of tulips; thou didst drape the window with thy petticoat; I used the terra cotta bowl and let thee take the Nipponese draught. And those abundant hardships which tickled our humor-sense! Thy cuff seared, thy ascot misplaced! And that beloved portrait of the transcendant Shakespeare which we didst pawn one evening so that we might eat! I was a mendicant, and you, eleemosynary. I kissed thy virginal, plush arms in hurried passion. An omnibus work of Dante was our table from which we feasted happily on a centime's purchase of chestnuts. The initial instance, in my ecstatic den, of stealing a kiss from thy passionate mouth, when thou didst retreat, mussed and flushed, I paled dreadfully and was certain of the Creator's existence. Dost thou recollect our uncountable joys, and all the victorines gone to seed?
