E-ne-pee--a steam-cleansing is a rite of purification prefatrory to the sacred festivals. The so-called "vapor bath" is administered in this manner: "Several poles the diameter of hoop-holes or smaller are fetched, and with their stouter ends being inserted into the ground in a circle, the pliable tops are bowed inward and joined with twine at their central meeting place. This skeleton is then overlaid with cloaks and blankets, with the exception of a small opening on one side passing for a doorway. In front of this hole, a middling-sized fire is started, and round rocks roughly the size of an adult human's head are placed into the flames. The supplicant, stripped naked, takes a seat in the steam-infused tent, perspiring copiously from every pore, until he is nigh smothered. At times, it has been observed that more than one man will participate at the same time, singing and praying together.""Tahkoo Wakan," page 83. Monsignor Hennepin volunteered to undergo the vapor-bath at Mille Lacs with the endorsement of Chief Aqui-pa-que-tin some two hundred years ago. After explicating the process, Hennepin avers: "When the Chief talked me into doing the bath three times in the space of a week, I ended up feeling as strong as I ever have." Shea's Hennepin, page 228. For a very thorough and authentic treatment of the Dakota Medicine Men and their rituals, etc., see Chapter II, Neill's History Minnesota.
