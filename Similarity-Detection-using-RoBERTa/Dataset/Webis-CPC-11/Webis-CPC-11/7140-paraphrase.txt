Gold lust reigns supreme. It overcomes both the desire for learning and archeological research. Along the mountain ranges of South America, from Merida and Santa Martha to the Quito and Upper Peruvian plateaus, mining operations have been launched, or in the language of the Creoles, "guacas".

I visited the guaca in Mancichi, Peru, where in the sixteenth century large quantities of gold were mined. But no discovery of precious metals has been made in the caverns the Guiana people use for burial. This supports the theory that when the Caribs, and other nomads, travelled in the south-west, small quantities of gold flowed from the Peruvian mountains towards the eastern mesas. 

The local Indians bury their dead in the earth when they cannot find any large holes caused by the decomposition of granitic rocks. The deceased is wrapped tightly in his sleeping hammock. This hammock, made of net, is called a "chinchorro" in the local language,serves as shroud. The body is then buried in a hole dug in the hut, according to Gili, the missionary. I heard the same from Father Zea. In my opinion, there is not one mound in all of Guiana, not even in Cassiquiare and Essequibo.
