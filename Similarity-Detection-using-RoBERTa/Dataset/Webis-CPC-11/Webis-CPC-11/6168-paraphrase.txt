You would be cutting Masaniello short if you did not consider his actions against his wishes. His belief regarding Naples was in tune of people’s support of it, not his own political ego, he is noted in this 1828 record incident. On July 12 th the 6th day of his so called contradiction he was asked by a lady to wear a crown, but he instead insisted he wear a crown of the local events (a plant one of all things) in recognition of his peoples customs. It would later go on like this, in his statements of rebellion. “When I have delivered my country I shall resume my nets. You will find them no more. Rebellion should not be undertaken, or it should be carried on to the end. I will resume my nets. He was responded to by a aggravated monitor, “What then shall I find?—Death!”. Masaniello is in this case seen in the sense of looking out for its peoples customs, rather than its takeover through tribute. Despite this he was forced to consider the safety of his people, through Genuino, and d’Arpaya, how that these riches were the safeguard of its peoples customs in light of Philip IV. His characteristics as a man would fall to the same state of mankind, wanting one thing but ultimately falling to another in order to get by, his problems only known full well to him. 


LONDON. 
This was literally translated from a Chinese Poem, when a chineseman visited England in 1813. 
The towering edifices rise story above story, In all the stateliness of splendid mansions: Railings of iron thickly stud the sides of every entrance; And streams from the river circulate through the walls; The sides of each apartment are variegated with devices; Through the windows of glass appear the scarlet hangings. And in the street itself is presented a beautiful scene; The congregated buildings have all the aspect of a picture.
