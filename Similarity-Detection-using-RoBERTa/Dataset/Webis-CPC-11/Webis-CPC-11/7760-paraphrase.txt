The privilege it has amused Almighty God towards grant towards a number of of our witnesses, must not towards be thinly communicated and made cheap. I possess my ears battered with a thousand such tales as these: "Three fellows observed him such a day within the east three, the next day within the west: at such an hour, within such a site, and within such habit"; on point I should not suspect it myself. How much many natural and necessarily do I encounter it that two men should lie than that one man within twelve hours' moment should fly with the wind from east towards west? How much many natural that our experience should be shouldered from its site via the volubility of our disordered minds, than that one of ourselves should be shouldered via a strange mettle upon a broomstaff, flesh and bones as we are, up the shaft of a chimney? Let not ourselves seek illusions from without and unknown, we whom are always agitated with illusions domestic and our own. Methinks one is pardonable within sceptical a miracle, at lowest, at everybody events whereas one can escape its verification as such, via processes not miraculous; and I am of St. Augustine's feedback, that, "'tis better towards thin towards doubt than assurance, within things steely towards prove and grave towards believe."

'Tis already a number of years ago that I drifted across the lands of a queen prince, whom, within my favour, and towards abate my incredulity, did me the honour towards lent me see, within his own presence, and within a confidential site, ten or twelve prisoners of this kind, and amongst others, an old woman, a actual witch within foulness and deformity, whom long had been known within that profession.
