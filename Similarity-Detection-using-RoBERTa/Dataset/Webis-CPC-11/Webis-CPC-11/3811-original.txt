These are the true principles
of Christianity, and a church departs from the Gospel whenever these principles are neglected.

In adopting, however, these principles, and making them practically one's own, it must never
be forgotten that there is a danger of confounding them, as they are unhappily too often confounded,
with the results of a philosophy, falsely so called, which would teach governments to be indifferent
to the religion of their people,     (p. 330) and would encourage individuals to take no interest
in the dissemination of religious truth. East is not more opposed to west, than the spirit
of persecution, which would compel others by secular punishments to make profession of whatever
doctrines the government of a country may adopt, is opposed to that Christian wisdom which
maintains it to be equally the bounden duty of the state to provide for the religious instruction
and comfort of its members, as it is the duty of a father to train up his own children in the
faith and fear of God. The poles are not further asunder, than that holy anxiety for the salvation
of our fellow-creatures which would impel Christians, to the very utmost bound of the sphere
of their influence, to promote as well unity in the faith as the bond of peace and righteousness
of life, is removed from that narrow bigotry which fixes on those who differ from ourselves
the charge of wilful blindness, and obstinate hatred of the truth, to be visited by man's rebuke
here, and God's displeasure for ever.[251] A wise and pious writer of our own has said,[252]
(p. 331) "Show me the man who would desire to travel to heaven alone, regardless of his fellow-creature's
progress thitherward, and in that same person I will show you one who will never be admitted
there." The principle applies equally to an individual and a commonwealth.
