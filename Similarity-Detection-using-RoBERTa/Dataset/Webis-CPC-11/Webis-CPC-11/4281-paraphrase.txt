French in pursuit of their enemies broke into Friedland. The city was in flames, fugitives have fled to the bridges, very few have succeeded in achieving them when it means only safety was snatched from her, bridges were cut and fire when Marshal Ney entered possession burning remains of Friedland. At present the same general body Gortschakoff, pressed Marshals Lannes and Mortier, fighting bravely in a hopeless position, tried in vain to recapture the city, and then redescended river length, hoping to find passages that can be passed foot. Many soldiers drowned, others succeeded in regaining the right bank. Almost the entire column General Lambert managed to escape. Followed a long night long twilight, it was ten o'clock at night, when the fight ended. The victory was complete, the remains of the Russian army withdrew at Pregel Napoleon, without being able to meet again. They won soon afterwards Niemen. Meanwhile, the Marshal Soult took Koenigsberg, evacuated Lestocq generals and Kaminsky. King of Prussia possessed nothing more than small town of Memel.

Emperor Alexander had returned to his troops, defeated and decimated, despite their courage, King Frederick William placed himself close ally, Tilsit. Russians have become necessary for peace, for the Prussians were so long. Napoleon had gone to negotiate for him. In response to the request for a truce, he proposed an interview with the Emperor Alexander. It was in the middle Niemen, a series made for the purpose, the two emperors met.

Alexander was young, helpful, successful, sometimes drawn along chivalrous or mystic feelings and enthusiasms, sometimes under the domination of oriental tastes and passions. Nobody could be more likely to be influenced by the charm of a superior genius and a great destiny, and personal ascension of a man who knew least how to please and how to otherwise.

Napoleon wanted to capture the enemy defeated, he wanted to be his ally, he managed to do this easily.
