The commissioner will allow me to get a jump on the enemy. 

The arguement was based on local news, not law. 

Commissioner: Mr. Lunt. 

Lunt: No need to be so formal. 

Commish: This dude says that he has proof of his arguement from the local paper. 

Mr. Dana: He says it's fawking evidence that will hold up in COURT. WTF?!? Eh, who cares? I'm sure that the commissioner will take care of it. 

Well, I have to exercize caution considering that I have no idea what will happen next. I won't come in with false evidence, I'll just make arguements based on what is said in court. 

Your Honor, if you don't mind, we aren't from around here, so, I'm just saying, we vote and decide as one. 

This law is not applicable here for it does not suit us. Why defy then and accept now? We will rebel as one. 

Well, we may not all agree...

Still, majority rules. "We the people", yadda, yadda, yadda... We must have law!

The law is the law, man. 

Then how was this passed? 

It was voted on by the people we voted for, the representatives of the city. 

The Senator okayed it. Allot of people to the North liked and voted for it as well. If you don't like it then we repeal and revote, or we can challenge with a new proposal. Either way, we must not give in to complacency. 

It must be that this law is repealable. If it is not, then we may be excluded from the chance to make our voices heard. It is the name of peace and equality that it must be so.
