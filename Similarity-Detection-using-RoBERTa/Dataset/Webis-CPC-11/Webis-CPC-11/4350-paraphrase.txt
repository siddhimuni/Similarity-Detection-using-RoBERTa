No sound of war is to be heard in it, and when I think how completely some of our novelists have failed when trying to deal with contemporary events can not be too happy that this novel is set in a period before the Germans became an uncivilized people. Olive, the heroine, a lovely girl, is baby supposititious Wenborough Sir James, whose wife, in his absence and without his knowledge, provided it as a substitute for their child, who died at birth. Secret is disclosed by an unscrupulous flirt who uses her knowledge gained to push its way Wenborough household. Men are not the strongest points of Madame ALBANESI but Wenborough Roderick Michael Guye and characters have better contrast, and the worst that can be said of them is that they are rather types of values. Overall, a book that many people would describe as "perfectly sweet, but due to its sympathetic quality workmanship and sound, deserves a more distinctive label.

When the hero lean brown hawk lip extends an arm of steel six-cylinder Rolls-Royce, where he is lounging and snatches from the jaws very beautiful model of a community, we realize that we are in the presence of Romance in its purest form. A walk in the park and a cozy dinner in a restaurant in Soho, are quite sufficient to convince the hero and heroine that they each own. Some novelists would let it go at that, but Mr. Arthur APPLIN who had taken only in Chapter II, and wants to give us value for our money. What is to come as SHAKSPEARE said, still uncertain, but it seems that the heroine, who went to break the happy news to a poor but respectable aunt in Devonshire, the country met at the station by a driver, which requires a "Miss Alice" and its waves to a large limousine. She knows that there is Lady Alice and has no car to meet her, but she hops in all. She does not know where it happens, but it is on its way. There is a break, and when it comes to the heroine she is called Lady Alice a family castle. Everything has been erased from her memory, including its identity and that of the hero and the author can now make a new start. If you want to know how everything ends, you must obtain woman who was not (Ward Lock), but there is no convincing reason why it should.
