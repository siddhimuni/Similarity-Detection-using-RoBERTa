lllinois, where he made ashort isitat his 
parents home now in Coles County, and in
July went to New Sale, to take charge of a
store and mill owned by Denton Offutt.  who 
had emploed him on the flatboat [A] The 
goods for the new store had not arrived when 
Lincoln reached New Salem.

Obliged to turn his hand to something, he
piloted down the sangamon and llinois rivers,
as far as Beardstown. a flatboat bearing the 
family and goods of a pioneerbound for Taxas

At Beardstown he found Offutt's goods waiting
to be taken to New Salem

As he footed his way home he met two men

supposed him to have one thousand dollars
worth of goods in stock

the goods. the store was opened in a little log
house on the brink to the hill. almost over the
river.

The copy of Kirkhan's Grammar studied by
lincoln belonged to a man named Vaner
Some of the biographers say lincoln borrowed
[it] but it appears that he became the owner of
the book.  either by purchase or through the generosity of Vaner, for it was never returned
