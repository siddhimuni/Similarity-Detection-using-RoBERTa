It is ridiculous to see an American guy behaving like this. I do not consider such a man any different than a snooty road side person. If possible I would have banged him just the same way I would have done with the street guy. Otherwise, if law would not permit, I would have shot the man dead on the road, where ever I found him, just like the crude Southerners would do when one causes some irretrievable damage to them. 

Contesting with such a person does not make any sense nor is it justified. It is some ting like if a man has stolen your coat, instead of putting him behind the bar, you are deciding who the winner is.

“But what if someone is spreading some fake rumors about you like you are not a decent man or maybe you have deceived some one?”

 “Bah!”  Benson exclaimed Misleadingly. Skillfully he escaped the most significant aspect of the question and said “If any one spreads false rumor about me, I will knock him down. 
One person in the room disgustingly maligned me, as he could four years back, and had almost ruined my marriage. The Storey Hunter -the fat man with all the ornaments.”
“Really!” The other man was really surprised. He had just noticed Mr. Benson talking to that hefty person in a most friendly manner.
“That’s right. It was totally friendly. I never annoyed that rascal!” -  exclaimed Benson. He turned pale and then red hot “hope he is not dancing with my wife! The audacity of this man is un-believable. The women have no self esteem. They can go to any extent with a man if only he is a good dancer”
