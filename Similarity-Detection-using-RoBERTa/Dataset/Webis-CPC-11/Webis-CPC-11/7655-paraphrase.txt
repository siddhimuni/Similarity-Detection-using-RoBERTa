My mom took a job as a chef for a white family, and I worked for Mr. Jeff Fisher. I drove Mr. Fisher's laundry truck thirty five years for the company L.R. Wyatt, which was located at the corner of Jones and Salisbury street.

Cenoro Freeman and I were wedded December 9, 188, and married fifty-six years. Cenoro had a good, honest heart and I never loved anyone more. She passed away-fateful day!-in May 1934. George Washington was a courageous, honest man, but I have only observed him from a distance.  Abraham Lincoln was one of my closest confidant, because he set me free. The Lord is my truest divine friend. Jefferson Davis is somewhat of a mystery, but Jim Young and I were friends.

I joined the church to help others, myself included, live a decent life full of service to humankind and for God.
