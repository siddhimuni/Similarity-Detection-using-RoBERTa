As per the decision  of the district of Florac   and of the statement of the commissioner of the disturbances  department in Espagnac, the constitutional cure, Richard ordered the municipality to take action to install him on 5th of July.But the  protests and hooting from the part of women and children made it impossible to enter the church for the ceremony. They obstrcted the church door and they shouted to kill him as he is a protestant married and having children.  But at last on the July 6th the installation of him is made with great difficulty.
