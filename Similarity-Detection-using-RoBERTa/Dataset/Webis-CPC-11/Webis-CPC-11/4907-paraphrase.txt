And also the cost of their operation is formally imposed on them, this day, [63,103] in the sum-total of 131 million francs annually primary training costs, municipalities contribute 50 million francs, 1878-1891, in-total 582 million francs spent on school buildings, contributed 312 million francs .-- If the parents are not satisfied with this system some have only to subscribe to each other, build a private school at their own expense and support the sisters in the Christian Brothers as teachers. This is their business, they will not pay one cent more than for the municipality, or state department so that their fee will be doubled and will pay twice, first for primary instruction they dislike, and then they're the primary instruction .-- Thousands of private schools is based on these conditions. In 1887, [63 104] they had 1,091,810 students, about one fifth of all children included in all primary schools. Thus, a fifth of parents do not want the secular system for their children, at least, they prefer other when others are given, but to offer them, very large donations, a variety of voluntary subscriptions, are necessary. Distrust and dislike that the system imposed from above turn can be measured by number of parents and children and the greatness of donations and subscriptions. Note, moreover, that many other municipalities, in all places where resources, common understanding and generosity of individual donors and founders are not enough, parents, suspicious and even hostile, are now forced to send their children to school, which is incompatible with them .-- To be more precise, imagine an official daily log and journal called secular, free and compulsory for children six to thirteen, founded and supported by the state, to an average cost of 582 million francs to trigger it, and 131,0000,000 francs in annual costs, all taken from the purses of taxpayers, willingly or not, take it for granted that 6 million children, girls and boys, six to thirteen, are required to subscribe this diary, you get each day, except Sundays, that every day, are required to read the paper by six o'clock. The state, through tolerance, allows parents who do not like to take another official sheet, they agreed, however, that another may be at hand, it is necessary that local benefactors, associated together and taxed themselves should be willing to establish and support it, otherwise, the family father is forced to read his children's secular journal, which he considers poorly composed and superfluities and affected by weaknesses in short edited in a spirit unacceptable.
