In practice"clauses of the social contract reduce themselves to one, namely [the total transfer of each associate with all its rights to the community."3420] Each surrender completely,"just where he stands, he and all his forces, as his property constitutes a part."There is no exception nor reservation, what he may have been before, and what could have belonged to him no longer his own.
