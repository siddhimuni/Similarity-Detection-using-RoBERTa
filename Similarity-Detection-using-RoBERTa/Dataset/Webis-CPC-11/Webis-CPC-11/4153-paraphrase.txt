No statistical explanation of England has recently announced that we can detect, which would give us something real picture of the current average rent of land in this country [31], but we believe that all the information we have been able to acquire for the consultations addressed to the competent and knowledgeable people that can not be reduced to less than 25 years. one hectare. Since the last census we learn that Ireland Ireland contains 20,399,608 acres statute, and that the rent is estimated at L12, 715 478 - give a little more than 12 years. As the average rent. [32] Taking into account that the tenant pays the tenth English - as in many municipalities, amounting to more than all the average income obtained from Irish soil, which pays poor rates, and which is heavily taxed by the highway Toll and other local assessments, and that the Irish tenant does not pay tithe, and only half of the types of poor, there are no toll road, a lone exception them near cities or large towns, which, in fact, only tax that the county pay is late, which vary in different counties in ten pence to one and sixpence per acre every two years and that this assessment will be greatly reduced under the new laws of the grand jury, under which towns and Knights homes value and pay taxes - when we say all these things are taken into account and also the land in Ireland is obviously better and more productive than English soil we believe we have successfully sold in a serious accusation against the host Irish and we have shown that it can be exorbitant financial burden, as he complains, which makes a big difference between the social status of Irish and British occupiers.

No doubt it will say - "Yes, but the tenant is English, and their exploitation remain in good condition, as owner, while the Irishman is forced to do it all yourself!" This is true, but certainly the accession of the Irish tenant farmer on his farm, but it makes a small addition to their other commitments. Gates and fences, which has, in relative terms, no, and if shown to him, he soon suffered to go to ruin.
