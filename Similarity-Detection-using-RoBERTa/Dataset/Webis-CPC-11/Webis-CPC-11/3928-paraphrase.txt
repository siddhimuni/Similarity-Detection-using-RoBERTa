Polignac's infantry, twelve 100 muskets, was sent on the Boeuf in sustaining way of the two last. Liddell's seven 100 newly-organized horse, with four armaments, was of little service past making feints to sidetrack the enemy.
Major arrived at his location on the 30th, and on the following day, the 1st of May, ensnared and descended the transport Emma. On the 3d he ensnared the transport City Belle, on her way up to Alexandria, with the 120th Ohio regiment on board. All the staff and two 100 and seventy-six men were taken, with more murdered and wounded. On the night time of the 4th the gunboats Covington and Signal, each getting on eight weighty armaments, with the transport Warner, endeavoured to pass. The Covington was blown up by her crew to elude ensnare, but the Signal and Warner surrendered. Four armaments, two three-inch rifled and two howitzers, were engrossed in this achievement with the Covington and Signal. They were run up to the river's bank by hand, the howitzers atop, the three-inch firearms under the gunboats, which, overpowered by the quick blast, moved back and ahead until one yielded and the other was demolished, affording a whole illustration of the superiority of paddock armaments to gunboats in tapered streams. There was no farther endeavour to go beyond Major's location, and Federal making acquaintance with the Mississippi was blocked for fifteen days.

During these performances the opponent was engrossed after dark and day in the makeup of a dam through the Red River, to empower him to go beyond his fleet over the falls; and the following extracts from the report of Admiral Porter to the Secretary of the Navy well show in public the relative standing of actions in and throughout Alexandria ("Report on the Conduct of the War," vol. ii., piece of paper 250)
