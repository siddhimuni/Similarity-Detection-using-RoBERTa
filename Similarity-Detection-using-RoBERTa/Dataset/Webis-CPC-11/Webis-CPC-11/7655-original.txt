Mother went to cooking for the white folks, but I worked for Mr. Jeff Fisher. I held a job
thirty-five years driving a laundry truck for L. R. Wyatt. The laundry wus on the corner of
Jones an' Salisbury Street.

I married Cenoro Freeman. We lived together fifty-six years. She wus a good devoted wife. We
wus married Dec. 9, 1878. She died in May 1934. [HW: bracket] Booker T. Washington wus a good
man. I have seen him. Abraham Lincoln wus one of my best friends. He set me free. The Lawd
is my best friend. I don't know much 'bout Jefferson Davis. Jim Young an' myself wus pals.

My object in joining the church wus to help myself an' others to live a decent life, a life
for good to humanity an' for God.
