Most of the opium dens were underground.

The majority of the people of chinatown lived in what were little better than rat holes, dark, poorly ventilated little cells on the side of narrow passages in basements. The rich merchants and importers lived well, but the middle and poorer classes lived in the basements where rent was cheap. Of the 24,000 chinese population only about 900 were women so chinatown was a bachelor's town by a large majority, though some of the residents had wives in china to whom they expected to return some day. The rule in the basements was for ten men to sleep in a room six by ten feet and do their cooking over a little charcoal fire in one corner of the room. The beds they slept in were simply bunks. The population of chinatown had somewhat decreased since the exclusion act was passed. Few chinamen came over and many, having saved up a little fortune, had gone back to china to stay. Of the entire population of chinatown there were about 1,000 who voted; they constituted the native born element. The men and women dress much alike.

One of the sights which the inquisitive traveller to the pacific coast rarely missed was the chinese theater. Entrance was gained through the rear from an alley by the payment of 50 cents for a ticket. After walking down a narrow passageway, climbing up two flights of stairs and down three ladders one reached the green room in the rear of the stage where one saw the actors in all the glory of oriental costume. No foreigners, as americans were regarded, were allowed in any part of the theater except on the stage where half a dozen chairs were reserved on one side for visitors who came in the back way. There was no drop curtain in front of the stage and the orchestra was located in the rear of the stage. The orchestra would attract attention anywhere. The music was a cross between the noise made by a boiler shop during working hours and a horse fiddle at a country serenade.

As one walked along the streets of chinatown he noticed on many doorways a sign which read something like this: "merchants' social club. None but members admitted." there would be a little iron wicket on one side of the door through which the password goes and some chinese characters on the walls. There were dozens of these clubs in chinatown, all incorporated and protected by law. But they were simply gambling joints into which men of other nationalities were not admitted, and where members could gamble without fear of interruption by the police. Chinamen are born gamblers and will wager their last dollar on the turn of a card. Perhaps if 25,000 americans or englishmen or russians were located in the heart of a chinese city without any of the restraining influences of home life, they would seek to while away their idle hours at draw poker or as many other forms of gambling as john chinaman indulges in.
