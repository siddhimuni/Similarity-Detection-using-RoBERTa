Another method of disposing of manure has been recommended by writers in English. Manure pile is built into a compact rectangular whose sides are hard to beat, with shovels. Land around the edges heap is smooth and hard and loose straw is placed around small windrows of trash about a foot from the edge. Exclusion of air with high temperature and gases formed by fermentation, tends to pile unfavorable for larval development of flight. Those who happen to develop in the superficial layers migrate and kiss the ring of straw around the heap, where they are destroyed by burning.

Garbage disposal and treatment MISCELLANEOUS breeding localities.

It is equally true that farmed conditions in cities as places for reproduction, other than horse manure must be attended to. Trash must be removed, pig and poultry manure to be handled, and especially dairy farms, it is extremely important that all precautions be taken to prevent contamination of milk by the fly.

It is highly desirable that all possible refuse accumulated from cities and towns, to be burned. Incineration has been successfully practiced by a number of cities with population from 10,000 to 15,000 years and older. In larger cities such provision be made for burning carcasses and other garbage and refuse. If town and city garbage feeder pigs sold municipal authorities should have control of sanitary conditions on feeding sites, since there is great danger of fly breeding in such places, if not kept clean.

Sewage in terms of fly-borne disease prevention.

In consideration of these measures we've reached the home remedies for fly breeding in human excrement. On account of the danger of typhoid, transport, human excrement falling outdoors in cities or towns, or in vacant lots or in dark corridors, should be made a crime, and the same care should be taken by health authorities to remove or cover, such as deposition is taken in removing the bodies of dead animals.
