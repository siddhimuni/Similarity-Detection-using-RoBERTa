MARCH 1, 1916

CHARIVARIA.

The Volunteers have at last been recognised. There has been nothing like it since the great
recognition-scene in Electra.

       ***

The case has been reported of a Stepney child which has developed a disease of the brain, as
the result of an air raid. Similar cases are said to have been observed in the neighbourhood
of Fleet Street.

       ***

It now transpires that the music of St. Paul's Cathedral emanates from an organ of German construction.
There seems to be some doubt as to whether an explanation is due from The Westminster Gazette
or The Times.

       ***

The mysterious shortage of butter in Germany, which has resulted in measures being drafted
limiting the consumption to 4 ozs. per week per adult, is now explained. Count VON BERNSTORFF
has used up all the available supplies on Congress.

       ***

The General Omnibus Company has made the announcement that it will not employ any women drivers
for its omnibuses. The company's officers fear that if women were so employed there would be
an absence of that racy repartee which alone prevents traffic from reaching a condition of
indescribable congestion.

       ***

The demand for second-hand pianos now for the first time in the history of the trade far exceeds
the supply. It is not only in Germany that War and frightfulness go hand-in-hand.

       ***

The capture of Mush by the Russian army of the Caucasus is an event the importance of which
has not been fully recognized. It is undoubtedly the place from which the Turkish official
reports of victory have been issued.

       ***

The Marconi Company have announced that "deferred plain language telegrams" will again be received.
More truckling to the Tory Press!

       ***

A traveller returning from East Africa reports that, notwithstanding the military operations
that are taking place in various parts of the country, rhinoceroses appear to be increasing
in numbers. It is explained that the falling-off in the European demand for potted reed birds
is responsible for the phenomenon.

       ***

It is announced that the Cabinet are to take a portion of their salaries in Exchequer Bonds.
Not to be outdone the members of the Reichstag are said to have agreed to soil their fingers
with dirty British gold rather than hinder the German Government's operations for correcting
the depreciation of the mark.

       ***

The suggestion has been put forward that, as a timely War economy, well-to-do people should
give up their hot-houses. There seems to be a division of opinion, however, as to whether the
hot-house plants should be given their liberty, or (as economy would seem to dictate) be killed
for the table.

       ***

Australia has suspended the trade-marks of 450 German articles. It would be interesting to
know if the most historic German trade-mark, "MADE IN THE UNITED STATES," is among these.

       ***

"Mr. Julian Kimball (of Covent Garden and the London Opera House)," says the Musical critic
of The Daily Mail, "is a singer you can watch as well as listen to." The desirability of concealing
the faces of some of our principal singers in the past is undoubtedly one of the reasons why
England has lagged behind in the musical art.

       ***

A well-known candidate for the East Herts Division is said to be urgently in need of motor
cars. His opponents however point out that the need to economise in petrol was never more urgent
than at present.

       ***

Speaking on the question of the shortage of freights Mr. RUNCIMAN stated, a few days ago, that
he did not know that ostrich feathers took up much room. Has he never been to a matin√©e?
