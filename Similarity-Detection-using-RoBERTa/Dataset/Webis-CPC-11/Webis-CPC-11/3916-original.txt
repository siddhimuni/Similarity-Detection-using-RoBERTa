Accompanied by two expensive-looking men, whose ancestors had beyond any doubt crossed the
Red Sea with Moses, this new and glittering star, who had but just "made good," or "got over,"
or "clicked" (my new acquaintance used all these phrases indiscriminately when referring to
his own Herschellian triumphs as a watcher of the skies), walked confidently to a distant table
which was being held in reserve for her party, and drew off her gloves with the happy anticipatory
assurance of one who is about to lunch a little too well. (All this, I should say, happened
before the War. I am reminded of it to-day by the circumstance that I have just heard of the
death of the agent whom I then met.)

The impact of the lady on this gentleman was terrific.

"Look, look!" he said. "That's Ella Reeve, one of my discoveries. She was principal boy at
Blackpool two years ago. I put her there. She got fifteen pounds a week, and to-day she gets
two hundred. I spotted her in a chorus, asked her to call and see me, and this is the result.
I made her. There's nothing she wouldn't do for me, she's so grateful. If she knew I was in
the room she'd be over here in a jiffy."

Having told us all this, he, being a very normal man, told it again, all the while craning
his neck in the hope that his old client (she had now, it seemed, passed out of his hands,
having forsaken panto for London and revue) might catch sight of his dear face. But she was
far too much occupied either with the lobster on her plate or with the yellow fluid, strange
to me, that moved restlessly in a long-stemmed shallow glass at her side.

And then, being, as I say, not in any way an eccentric or exorbitant character, the agent told
it us a third time, with a digression here and there as to the deep friendships that members
of his profession could form and cement if only they were decent fellows and not mere money-grubbing
machines out for nothing but their commission.
