The day had fallen, and every thing looked dull and dreary; the foot-path was
encumbered by mud, and porters carrying weights, as well as other busy passengers, were jostling
each other to obtain a footing on the dirty pavement: a fellow heavy laden came in contact
with the royal reefer[6] so powerfully, that he took a lee-lurch, and got foul of one of the
seats in the arches. "Avast there; luff up, you lubberly rigged son of a gun," cried middy;
"couldn't you hail ship before you were aboard of us?" The fellow, however, waddled on; but
the middy had to turn about in order to regain his course, when suddenly he beheld a middle-aged
figure, perishing with cold, a red night-cap on, an old jacket and trousers, a pair of shoes
in rags attached to his legs with a rope's end, no shirt, no stockings, nor any other attire;
the face was climate-struck, it had braved the equator and the pole, the battle and the breeze,
the scorching heat and the petrifying cold,--it was, as might be expected, thin, and moreover
almost lost in a profusion of hair on each cheek, so that it would be difficult for the oldest
acquaintance to recognise the features after long absence; nature had made the lips to smile,
the eyes to beam in kindness, the fine high forehead to command respect; but time and hardships,
disease and disappointment, had quenched the fire of the organ of sight and intelligence, the
mirror of the soul,--had prematurely furrowed that front of honest English high spirit and
candour, and had taught the lips to fall in dejection and the treasured silence of woe: upon
the whole, the figure had something fierce in it, but it was truly manly; the warrior's arms
were folded together, and his face, bent towards the ground, was still half up-turned, and
seemed to say to rich merchants and venders passing by on foot and in carriages, "There ye
are, ye liers upon beds of down, ye feeders upon the poor man's toil; often have you slept
secure, and safely enjoyed your wealth, whilst poor Jack rode out the gale, hung on the rigging
betwixt life and death, and endured the storm which held him every moment betwixt the chance
of clinging to a fragment of the wreck and sinking into eternity: but, now the war is over,
smart-money paid for a sharp wound, and neglect and oblivion, are the seaman's portion." The
expression of his face and eyes seemed to speak thus; indeed, it spoke volumes; but its mute
appeal was lost on the worldlings, who brushed by him, and who, bent on love of gain, scarcely
were aware that their fellow-man was starving by their side, too feeble and too much an outcast
to work, yet too proud to beg; the middy's heart, however, was of that texture that it leant
towards a brother-sailor, meet him where it might, and he naturally looked round at poor Jack
on his beam-ends: he had but one penny in his pocket, and that the plaintive voice of a blind
woman had drawn, as if by magic, from its deep recess. What was to be done?--for he should
have liked to have taken this wreck of a man of war into tow. The reflection caused him to
examine more closely the shivering seaman, when a small scar, occasioned by a splinter, on
the bridge of the nose, brought to his remembrance Bob Clewlines, who had served in the same
ship: the tar recognised him also; but, so far from making himself known to him, he hid his
face in his hand: the reefer, however, was resolved to bring him to. "What, Bob Clewlines!"
cried he, "do I not hail an old shipmate in you, a quarter-master on board the ----, the bravest
heart of oak, the best reefer, and the merriest steersman of the whole ship's crew; and," said
he audibly, that every one passing might hear and value fallen courage and fidelity, "and as
prime a seaman as ever trimmed a sail, or served a gun; why, what has broke up your old hulk
this way?"
