The moment in which Arabella Crane proposes to Jasper Losely is the first moment in her life that she can recall being rebuked. She's spent months planning, composing lists of the pros and cons of marriage, itemizing it all bit by bit. Six months of her life are now worthless as Jasper laughs in her face, heedless of her cries for him to stop. 

"I'm sorry, Arabella, but you have to be kidding me," Jasper chuckles. "I love you like a sister, and that's exactly why I can't marry you. I can't sleep with my sister."

Arabella makes a last ditch effort. "But I love you," she protests. 

"Sure, you love me now. I'm the guy every mother warns their daughter not to fall in love with, and they do it anyway. I gamble; I drink, but because I'm easy on the eyes, women go and fall in love with me." He says it nonchalantly, with a casual shrug of the shoulders, and Arabella wants to scream in frustration. 

"Excuses," she snaps, testy now. "Being the stereotypical bad boy won't keep you warm at night."

Jasper clicks his tongue in disapproval and glances down at his watch. "Gotta go. I'm meeting some guys from the pool hall. Should be fun. Go take out that anger on somebody else. Try Sophy or maybe Rugge. Just don't come at me with this proposal bull again. Jeez, that was scary," he laughs. 

Arabella watches him go, her face set in hard lines of fury. No one tells her no. No one ever has. And as she wipes the tears from her eyes, she vows that Jasper Losely will be the last.
