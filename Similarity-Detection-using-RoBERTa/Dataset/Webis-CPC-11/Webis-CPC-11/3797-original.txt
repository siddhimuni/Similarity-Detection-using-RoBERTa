While it was musing the fire burned, and an irrepressible
conflict came. In the issue it was settled that no man should be held by another man in involuntary
servitude in this common and inseparable country.

A quarter of a century has elapsed since this settlement of a problem which involved the destiny
of two races, and of our whole country. The question now before the Nation and before the churches
is a corollary of slavery. It is the second section of the first chapter. The first question
was: How shall liberty be proclaimed to the captive and the enslaved become free? The second
is: Being free, how can the two races--as distinct and separate as are the white and black
races of the South--now equal before the law, live side by side under the same government,
and live in Christian truth and peace? This is the problem, and, like the first, it is irrepressible.

In one sense it is a new question--that is, a new generation of white people has in part come
forward to participate in the duties of citizenship, since all men became men in the law of
the land. To them the question is practically new. The situation as they find it, is this:
The Negroes, who, twenty years ago, were four millions, are now eight millions. The increase
of the blacks above the increase of the whites in the period of twenty years, is fourteen per
cent. In his work on the African in the United States, Professor Gilliam, having in hand the
figures of our Census Bureau, forecasts with the demonstration of mathematics our population
one century hence.
