Two types of sacrifices occur: splendid and simple.  Splendid sacrifices are often preformed by kings and are conducted with all the trappings of priests and sanctified ritual.  Simple sacrifices are more primitive in nature; examples are Saul's sacrifice (1Samuel xiv.35) and Elisha's sacrifice (1Kings xxix.21).  The sole criterion for determining whether the sacrifice is valid is whether or not it is dedicated to the God of Israel.  The only illegitimate sacrifice dedicated to the God of Israel is that of the heretical cultus outside of Jerusalem in the exilian redaction in the Book of Kings; all other sacrifices are shown to be valid.  For instance, Naaman (2Kings v. 17) makes an acceptable sacrifice even though he presumably followed Syrian ritualistic customs.  Though it is rare that the ritual itself is described, when sacrifices are described they are violent - which is in compliance with relevant laws.  The sacrifice Gideon makes in Judges vi. 19-21 is the most striking example of this, and it is clear from the description that his sacrifice resembles the procedure used in Ophrah during the narrarator's lifetime.  In Judges, Gideon boils a bull goat to create cooked meat and broth, bakes cakes of unleavened bread in ashes, and places the meal into a basket which he burns on an altar.  While it is possible that there may have also been sacrifices utilizing Pentateuch rules, this is irrelevant.  The most important feature is the lack of distinction between legitimate and heretical sacrifice.
