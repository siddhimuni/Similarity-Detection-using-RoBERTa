Blue clay filled the cracks and we used wooden
"chinkins" to make windows.  The roof was made by putting pieces of tree bark shingles one on top of the other.

The floor was made of puncheons, which made it a lot more functional than the more common bark flooring.

I really loved listening to and seeing the Red River carts as the squeaked by.

On them were lots of piles of furs.  They were driven by French half-breeds who pushed along next to them.  The small burly oxen would just seem to amble along on the trail.

A cow might be the beast used from time to time.  I saw a cow one time that had a buffalo calf with her.  It looked to belong to her.  Could it have been the first ever Cataloo?

At nine years of age, my dad told me to go to the spring to get a bucket of water.

As I was coming back speedily, as my father had asked me to, I suddenly found myself in the midst of Sioux warriers going to a Shakopee for a scalp dance.

They wanted that water, but I wouldn't give it to them and kept taking it back.  They actually got a kick out of my bravery and asked Little Crow, the chief to demand it of me.  I refused though because my father had wanted it.  They called me "tonka squaw" in a laughing way because it means brave woman.  Then they took off.

They were all decked out in their warpaint and feathers.

A dance meant wearing every embellishment available, but when they were fighting actual fights they didn't wear this stuff or hardly anything at all.

In 1843 I saw my first Fort Snelling soldiers in blue uniforms and cap that was tall and wide on top.  They wore a lot of brass and were impressive as they arrived at DeNoyer's for dinner just to get out.
