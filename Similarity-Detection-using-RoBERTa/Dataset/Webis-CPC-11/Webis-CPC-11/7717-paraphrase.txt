The floor of the center of the building was taken up by the imposing room. A door had been carved into the wall of the building facing north, just by Mr. Ballantyne's room. The front end of the space was broken up into three separate room, each only 7 x 12 feet. Field claimed one of the tiny spaces for himself, while Bates and I were stuck in between them. Of the three rooms mentioned, Field's was the only one that had any attempt at decoration. The brown juice of a tobacco plant stained the its floor and walls. In one corner, Field had a cupboard-shaped pigeon-file, alphabetically arranged for the clippings that he made daily. Almost all of those clippings contained some bit of personal gossip pertaining to the local celebrities. Dumbbells, Indian clubs, and other miscellaneous objects littered the floor of Field's room. Above Field's desk hung a sheet of tin, which he used as a call bell or to drown out the noise of the office boy poking the big globe stove.
