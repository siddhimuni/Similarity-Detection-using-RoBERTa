Still more would I like to go over again the many magnificent trips made across the interior
plains, mountains, and deserts before the days of the completed Pacific Railroad, with regular
"Doughertys" drawn by four smart mules, one soldier with carbine or loaded musket in hand seated
alongside the driver; two in the back seat with loaded rifles swung in the loops made for them;
the lightest kind of baggage, and generally a bag of oats to supplement the grass, and to attach
the mules to their camp.  With an outfit of two, three, or four of such, I have made journeys
of as much as eighteen hundred miles in a single season, usually from post to post, averaging
in distance about two hundred miles a week, with as much regularity as is done today by the
steam-car its five hundred miles a day; but those days are gone, and, though I recognize the
great national advantages of the more rapid locomotion, I cannot help occasionally regretting
the change.  One instance in 1866 rises in my memory, which I must record: Returning eastward
from Fort Garland, we ascended the Rocky Mountains to the Sangre-de- Cristo Pass.  The road
descending the mountain was very rough and sidling.  I got out with my rifle, and walked ahead
about four miles, where I awaited my "Dougherty."  After an hour or so I saw, coming down the
road, a wagon; and did not recognize it as my own till quite near.  It had been upset, the
top all mashed in, and no means at hand for repairs.  I consequently turned aside from the
main road to a camp of cavalry near the Spanish Peaks, where we were most hospitably received
by Major A---- and his accomplished wife.  They occupied a large hospital-tent, which about
a dozen beautiful greyhounds were free to enter at will.  The ambulance was repaired, and the
next morning we renewed our journey, escorted by the major and his wife on their fine saddle-horses.
