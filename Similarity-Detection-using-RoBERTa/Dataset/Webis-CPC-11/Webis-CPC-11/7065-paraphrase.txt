Sight, thusly, is given to not changing the location of the sensations or the placement of the capture, as well as to the recognition of these two aspects as being separate from one another--that is, the sensations as separate from the organ which senses them, as they are in reality. In this way, we should account for the mechanism for the discernment of distance by the eye; of the firm conviction that Sight could never have perceived of this distance were it not for the help of Touch.

In order to correctly understand the above reasoning--in fact, to push forward a single footstep towards inculcating a true philosophy of sensation--we need to rid ourselves of the bias indoctrinated to us by an inaccurate physiology, that what we refer to as our "organism", or in the accepted vernacular, our body, is unquestinably the center of our sensations. That all of our sensations end up connected in some manner with our physical body, and that some sensations even end up being associated with it in place, is incontestable; however, it is so far from the truth, that they are all basically involved with or internal to it, and are incapable of existing separated from it, that we find a straightforward proof of the opposite in the sensations of Sight; and until the physiologist can certify (that which has yet to be proven) a theoretical necessity that our sensation must be located in the same space with our bodies, and a theoretical absurdity in the opposite conjecture, he must pardon us for firmly supporting the facts as we see them. 

This is an opinion that generates a lot of discussion, and we would happily enlarge upon the subject if we had the time and space; however, we must settle for concluding the presentation with the accessory diagram, which we believe illustrates our view without any possibility of error.

Let A represent the first synthesis, or lack of separation between Sight and its snesations--of light and color.
