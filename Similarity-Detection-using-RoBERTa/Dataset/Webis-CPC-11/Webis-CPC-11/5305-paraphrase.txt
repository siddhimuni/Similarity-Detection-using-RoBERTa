[FN#98] The So To Sect was not wanting in competent teachers, for it might take pride in its Ten-key (1648-1699), whose religious insight was unsurpassed by any other master of the age; in its Shi gets, who was a commentator of various Zen books, and died 1764; in its Men-zany (1683-1769), whose indefatigable works on the exposition of So To Zen are invaluable indeed; and its Getsu-shu (1618-1696) and Man-zany (1635-1714), to whose labors the reformation of the faith is ascribed. Similarly, the Ran Zap Sect, in its Go-do (1579-1661); in its Ashy (1608-1646); in its Take-an (1573-1645), the favorite tutor of the third Shogun, Iye-mitsu; in its Haiku-in (1667-1751), the greatest of the Ran Zap masters of the day, to whose extraordinary personality and labor the revival of the sect is due; and its To-rein (1721-1792), a learned disciple of Haiku-in. Of the important Zen books written by these masters, Ro-jig-tan-kin, by Ten-key; Men-zan-ko-roku, by Men-zany; Ya-sen-kwan-wa, Soku-ko-roku, Kwai-an-koku-go, Kei-so-doku-zui, by Haiku-in; Shu-mon-mu-jin-to-ron, by To-rein, are well known.
It was about the middle of this period that the forty-seven vassals of Ado displayed the spirit of the Samurai by their perseverance, self-sacrifice, and loyalty, taking vengeance on the enemy of their deceased lord. The leader of these men, the tragic tales of whom can never be told or heard without tears, was Yoshiro-o (O-ashy died 1702), a believer of Zen,[FN#99] and his tomb in the cemetery of the temple of Sen-gaku-ji, Tokyo, is daily visited by hundreds of his admirers. Most of the professional swordsmen forming a class in these days practiced Zen. Mune-nori [FN#100] (Yo-yo), for instance, established his reputation by the combination of Zen and the fencing art.
[FN#99] See "Zen Shun," No. 151.
[FN#100] He is known as Ta-jims, who practiced Zen under Take-an.
The following story about Baku-den (Tsuka-hara), a great swordsman, fully illustrates this tendency:
"On a certain occasion Baku-den took a ferry to cross over the Abase in the province of Omi. There was among the passengers a Samurai, tall and square-shouldered, apparently an experienced fencer. He behaved rudely toward the fellow-passengers, and talked so much of his own dexterity in the art that Baku-den, provoked by his brag, broke silence. 'You seem, my friend, to practice the art in order to conquer the enemy, but I do it in order not to be conquered,' said Baku-den. 'O monk,' demanded the man, as Baku-den was clad like a Zen monk, 'what school of swordsmanship do you belong to?' Well, mine is the Conquering-enemy-without-fighting-school.' 'Don't tell a fib, old monk. If you could conquer the enemy without fighting, what then is your sword for?' 'My sword is not to kill, but to save,' said Baku-den, making use of Zen phrases; 'my art is transmitted from mind to mind.' 'Now then, come, monk,' challenged the man, 'let us see, right at this moment, who is the victor, you or I.' The gauntlet was picked up without hesitation. 'But we must not fight,' said Baku-den, 'in the ferry, lest the passengers should be hurt. Yonder a small island you see. There we shall decide the contest.' To this proposal the man agreed, and the boat was pulled to that island. No sooner had the boat reached the shore than the man jumped over to the land, and cried: 'Come on, monk, quick, quick!' Baku-den, however, slowly rising, said: 'Do not hasten to lose your head. It is a rule of my school to prepare slowly for fighting, keeping the soul in the abdomen.' So saying he snatched the oar from the boatman and rowed the boat back to some distance, leaving the man alone, who, stamping the ground madly, cried out: 'O, you fly, monk, you coward. Come, old monk!' 'Now listen,' said Baku-den, 'this is the secret art of the Conquering-enemy-without-fighting-school. Beware that you do not forget it, nor tell it to anybody else.' Thus, getting rid of the brawling fellow, Baku-den and his fellow-passengers safely landed on the opposite shore."[FN#101] The O Baku School of Zen was introduced by Yin Yuen (In-gem) who crossed the sea in 1654, accompanied by many able disciples.[FN#102] The Shogun ate gave him a tract of land at Fuji, near Kayo-to, and in 1659 he built there a monastery noted for its Chinese style of architecture, now known as O-Baku-san
