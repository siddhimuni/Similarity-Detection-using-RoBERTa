The attorneys defending the accused in the chancery suit,declared that Roger Tichborn was actually Arthur Orton,the youngest son of late George Orton,a butcher from high street,wapping.According to them Arthur had visited his family consisting of 3 sisters and a brother to check on them as he had lost touch with them for some years.His hush hush transactions with them were only a means to keep his identity a secret.

Though his Mother went and stayed with him she was not convinced that he was not an imposter.So she decided to leave Croydon and move to a hotel near Portman square.On 12th March 1868,she was found dead in a chair by a servant with no one at her side.

Out of all the obscure details of the Claimant's history,only two statements carried some weight.one being that he had been at Melipilla in Chile where he had known Thomas Castro,whose name he had taken up later;and the other one being that in 1854 he had been employed as a herdsman by Mr.William Foster of Boisedale,Gippsland,Australia.These statements would have been detrimental in proving the identity he had tried to establish for himself as Robert Tichborne.plus he seemed to have enough evidence and support for his stories.Maybe he thought that no one would bother to cross check or summon witnesses as both the said places are far apart.But the defendent applied and got the permission to go to these places to verify the facts even though the Claimant's side fought against it.Further adjournment and delay of the case occured when the claimant also sought permission to clear his name by accompanying the commission to Melipalli and producing his friend Thomas Castro before them.So money was raised and a party consisting of the claimant,solicitors,counsel and the commission set sail for Valparaiso and Melipilla, and finally for Victoria and New South Wales.However the Claimant went ashore at Rio stating he would continue to Melipilla overland on his own.But he never turned up and the commission had to go about collecting information and examining witnesses on their own.The Claimant had gone back to England after disembarking at Rio and abandoned the project.For his weird behaviour he made many lame excuses which were so not in his interest.
