He dyed Anno Dom. 1630." Ibid. (nonmoutshire), p.54.

The Christian name of Parsons was Walter not William, as stated by Harwood in these extracts. William was the Christian name of Evans, who was Parsons' successor. The same writer mentions a bas-relief that represents William Evans and Jeffrey Hudson, his diminutive fellow servant. It is found over the entrance of Bull-head Court, Newgate Street; not "a bagnio-court," which is nonsense. These words are cut on the stone: "The King's Porter, and the Dwarf". The date 1660 is also cut there. The bas-relief is engraved in Pennant.

There is a picture of Queen Elizabeth's porter at Hampton Court, but I'm unaware of any portrait of Parsons preserved in the Royal Collections.

Eisell and Wormwood Wine

(Vol. ii.,p.249)

If Pepys' friends actually drank the two quarts of wormwood wine he gave them, then Lord Braybrooke's suggestion must be correct in that it must have been made more palatable that the propomoa in use at Shakespeare's time. I have been furnished by a distinguished friend with the following, among other notes, corroborating my explanation of eisell:

"I have found no better recipe for making wormwood wine that that given by old Langham in his Garden of Health; and as he direct its use to be confined to 'Streine out a little spoonful, and drinke it with a draught of ale or wine,' I think it must have been so atrociously unpalatable, that to drink it up, as Hamlet challenged Laertes to do, would have been as strong an argumentum ad stomachum as to digest a crocodile, even when appetised by a slice of the loaf."

It is evident that only small doses of this nauseously bitter medicine were taken at once. To take a large draught "would be an extreme pass of amorous demonstration sufficient, one would think, to have satisfied even Hamlet."
