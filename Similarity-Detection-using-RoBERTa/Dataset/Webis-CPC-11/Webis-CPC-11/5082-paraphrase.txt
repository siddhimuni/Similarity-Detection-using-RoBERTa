he said the figures for the rail and wire were not available.Mr. kennerd then proceeded to tell me i could enter all my bids for the building in the specifications by 4 that day. I could have untill the 2nd of December for my bid on the copper wire and railroad iron. I asked for an extension providing i got the contract. I was told that the time could not be extended by evedn a day.After that i requested a list of the property so i could do my figures on all of it. Unfortunatley they did not have a list and we had to survey the land ourselfs to collect the data.Once we left the office we began the task of surveying the bulidings.At about 4 we went back to the office but were made to wait untill close to 5:30. The people we needed to see were having some sort of meeting with some men from the salvage committe. Once the meeting finished we were asked to enter the room,their were some men in the room i did not recognize, later i was told he was an insurance agent who held the claims on all the buildings there.I then handed the bid to a mr.kennerd Who proceeded to read it out loud. Mr kennerd told us that they had decided to handle all bids that day and we would need to put one in for the iron and wire as well. I informed him that it would be impossible to make an inteligent bid without first knowing the amount of iron and wire already purchased by them. I was told a mister evans had put in a bid sight unseen in three hours and asked why i could not do the same. I asked if they were sure it was a ligetement bid at wich point the president looked slightly questionable. The president then said that he had made a mistake and had 2,000 rails instead of 4,000 and that i had untill 11 pm to submit a bid.
