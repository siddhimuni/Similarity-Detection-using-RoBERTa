Dr.Jamees A. Bayard, was a descendent  of the famous "Chevalier" Bayard, a fact that exuded great influence on the members of his family in their public life including his son to a great extent. James A. Bayard, thus declined a French mission offered to him, stating that he feared it may come under suspicion of a deal being made. In a letter to a relative, he expressed that he shall never compromise on the great name he belonged to and he would not find satisfaction under the shadows of suspicion.

Bayard established himself in Delaware after training for the bar and was soon elected to the lower house of congress in 1796.  He was then promoted to the senate in 1804, re-electing him at the end of his term. After 9 years in 1813, he was selected by President Madison as one of the commissioners to wrap up the peace treaty with England.

Soon after accomplishing this mission, he was asked to be a minister to Russia, which he refused stating that he would continue with the administration when needed for the benefit of the public. He passed away in August of 1815

His solid, widespread knowledge of facts enabled his speeches to be presented in a logical sequence full of principles which was not the case with most public speeches. Hence his words were able to connect with only a few who could comprehend with deep thinking. They were never expected to be popular.

THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY

(Delivered on the Judiciary Bill, in the House of Representatives, on the Nineteenth of February, 1802) 

Mr. Chairman:-- 

I am surprised at the way in which the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Giles has approached the subject before us with his remarks. I expected him to take on a different line of conduct. I expected it especially because of the noble feeling which should have been inspired by the high position he holds on the floor of this house, as a work of peace, which he has often made clear during the session.
