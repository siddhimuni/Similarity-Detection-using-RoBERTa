This is a dignified work; there too is a couple of oils supposedly painted by Velasquez, "Galileo", and one "Mathematician." Due to the fact that Besancon enjoyed Spanish protection over the Master's lifetime, and that all sorts of prize artworks were collected by the Granvelles into their exquisite ch√¢teau, it should surprise no one that some of Velasquez's oeuvres should end up there. However, art experts will be called in to determine the authenticity of these two very real products of some artist.

Found in the same building is the free art academy for male and female students alike, which stands as one of the most successful schools in the city, and has operated since the year of its establishment, 1794. The second year curriculum includes drawing from model, and every means of assistance is afforded those who cannot manage the price of studying in Paris or simply the cost of private instruction in general. There also exists a free school of music, and sundry ecoles technique, both gratis, and co-educational.

And let us not forget the Academy of Science and Belle Lettres, that doesn't just offer a comprehensive curriculum of literary and scientific subjects, but also organizes lecture events open to all the public in October all the way through June. This series of discourses is comparable to the Winter program at our Royal Institution, (although in our case, you must be of the upper middle class and true upper class to attend!) and, in addition to extending an uncommon highbrow celebration to the devotees of science and letters on the whole, is extremely handy for under-priveleged students. In fact, so generous is the municipality of Besancon in this matter that any chap fortunate enough to obtain a nomination to the Lyceum, may complete his course of study and take the examination without ever opening his purse.
