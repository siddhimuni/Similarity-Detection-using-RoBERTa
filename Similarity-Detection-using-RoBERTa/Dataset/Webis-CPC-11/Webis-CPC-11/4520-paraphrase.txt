The Library of Abbotsford  is full of unfinished manuscripts and letters which include ten volumes of correspondence made by Sir.Walter with the famous writers of his time. In his Will he directed to give these to his creditors. Lockhart his son-in -law  also own a great number of letters from Sir.Walter, and Mrs. Terry, Wife of his intimate friend also possess baronet's correspondence with the late Mr.Terry. Mrs. Terry also own a tragedy written by Sir.Walter for her eldest son,Walter Scott Terry and Sir.Walter intended it as legacy for his first appearance on the stage. 
         A competent biographer will be able to portrait Sir.Walter's acquaintances with the materials mentioned above and his autobiographical sketches prefixed to his works.Mr.Allan Cunningham was bonded with truth,kindly feeling and tinged throughout with a delightfully poetic enthusiasm.Mr.Ballantyne, has promised a memoir of Sir. Walter as he was the printer of almost all works of him and the poet   respected  him for his taste and good sense.But the public rely on Lockhart. Ettrick Shepherd  announced tribute and virtues of his contemporary.He claimed that he is among the five people in the world who understand his character  and his mental portrait will not dispute with the original. 
    Hog is indebted to Sir Walter for many valuable suggestions  and he wrote in his dedication of the Mountain Bard to Scott that may the generous heart be blessed as he praised him for his advises  and the time he spend to correct his notes. His suggesions were as the song of parent when he sung for the baby in the cradle
