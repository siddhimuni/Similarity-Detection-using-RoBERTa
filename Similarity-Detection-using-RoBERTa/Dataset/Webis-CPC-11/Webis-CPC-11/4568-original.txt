There is something to be said in favour of the proposal, and
it is a pity that the merits of the question should have been somewhat obscured by the intolerable,
but to some persons perhaps attractive, suggestion that the additional expenditure necessary
for making education gratuitous should be supplied by the robbery of the Church, or (in politer
phrase) by the appropriation to the purposes of education of the national property hitherto
supplied to the support of religion. This cat can scarcely be said to have been let out of
the bag, for her head was no sooner seen peeping out than the alarm created was dangerously
great, and Puss was concealed again in a twinkling; but she is inside the bag still. A much
less objectionable proposal was speedily made, namely, that the deficiency created by the remission
of school-pence should be supplied by a Parliamentary grant. And this proposal, we presume,
may be regarded as at present before the country.

Looking upon the matter from a Chancellor of the Exchequer point of view, it is a serious thing
to think of having to make an addition of about two millions to the annual national expenditure;
and it may be observed that leading statesmen on both sides of politics may be found who are
at present unconvinced. Doubtless an expenditure of two millions would not be grudged by the
nation for any necessary purpose; but when the proposal is to substitute a payment of two millions
by the Exchequer for the two millions paid in driblets by the persons most interested, for
the most part gladly and with special provisions for preventing the payment pressing hardly
upon the exceptionally poor, it may well be that many sensible persons will ask the question,
Cui bono?

Independently, however, of any fiscal considerations, it seems to us that there are weighty
arguments against the proposal of a gratuitous education.

It may be observed, and we think it an important observation, that the proposal of free education
is in the teeth of all our recent policy; and some pressing reasons ought to be given for a
complete and sudden reversal of all that we have hitherto been doing. There are many free schools
in the country, endowed by 'pious founders,' and established for the special purpose of giving
free education to the children of particular parishes.
