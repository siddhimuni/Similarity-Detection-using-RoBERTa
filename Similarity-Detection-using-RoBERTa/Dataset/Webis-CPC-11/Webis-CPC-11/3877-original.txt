The parks of Detroit are numerous and their total area is about 1200 acres. By far the most
attractive is Belle Isle, an island in the river at the E. end of the city, purchased in 1879
and having an area of more than 700 acres. The Grand Circus Park of 4Â½ acres, with its trees,
flowers and fountains, affords a pleasant resting place in the busiest quarter of the city.
Six miles farther out on Woodward Avenue is Palmer Park of about 140 acres, given to the city
in 1894 and named in honour of the donor. Clark Park (28 acres) is in the W. part of the city,
and there are various smaller parks. The principal cemeteries are Elmwood (Protestant) and
Mount Elliott (Catholic), which lie adjoining in the E. part of the city; Woodmere in the W.
and Woodlawn in the N. part of the city.

Charity and Education.--Among the charitable institutions are the general hospitals (Harper,
Grace and St Mary's); the Detroit Emergency, the Children's Free and the United States Marine
hospitals; St Luke's hospital, church home, and orphanage; the House of Providence (a maternity
hospital and infant asylum); the Woman's hospital and foundling's home; the Home for convalescent
children, &c. In 1894 the mayor, Hazen Senter Pingree (1842-1901), instituted the practice
of preparing, through municipal aid and supervision, large tracts of vacant land in and about
the city for the growing of potatoes and other vegetables and then, in conjunction with the
board of poor commissioners, assigning it in small lots to families of the unemployed, and
furnishing them with seed for planting.
