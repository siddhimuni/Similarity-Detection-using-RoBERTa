The Master Spirits in disbelief give abundant evidence of their ignorance of the scriptures of the Bible. Not once in a thousand researched the writings of the Bible with pure and honest motives. Many of them never investigated it at all. To read a chapter here and there with the sole purpose of finding bugs and getting a difficulty, not research. An honest investigation requires a very different course. All tests must be taken to court and presented in such a way as to be understood, as was given, otherwise the court is not able to decide the case fairly. That all men like Colonel Ingersoll did not investigate what the Bible is evident from the fact that, to be like him ought to be unfaithful in their history. It is published to the world that the colonel had been born an infidel. He has been hacking on religion and the Bible since I was a toddler. So that infidelity is not the result of intelligent inquiry science or religion. I will not undertake to say what the Colonel's problems, but if he was born an infidel is possible, according to our law, he will die an unbeliever.

many infidels, which is governed by a spirit of fanaticism, of course, have worked as hard as if the world's salvation depended on his effort, without any hope of improving their condition, the false philosophy of materialism defending delivery a man nothing to live for, except his own animal nature. This philosophy says that everything is fine, as long as dodge the corners of the laws of your country. If the materialist can avoid paying fines and other penalties all the laws of your country, what need he care for a lifetime rather than another? You say he has a conscience? Well, maybe that will not burn to be past feeling. Very few men, I know, never reach that state depraved.
