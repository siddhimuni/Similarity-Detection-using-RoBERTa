WE REST ON THE TURF FOR A WHILE,FIRST THE CHILDREN MUNCH THEIR CAKES AND IMPRESS THE NOICE OF THE MILLWHICH IS OPPOSITE TO US,AND THE TREMBLING WATERS FOR ITS SOURCE IT WAS LIKE POURING A LITTLE CASCADES FROM THE DARK MOUNTAIN SIDE IN TO THE VALLEY.THE GROTTOES AND STALACTITE CAVERNS OF THEIR COMBE ARE MORE CURIOUS DISLIKE WITHIN AND WITHOUT, AND IN THEIR INMOST RECESSES IS A SMALL LAKE THE DEPTH OF THE LAKE WAS NOT EVER BEEN SOUNDED.BOTH THOSE LAKE AND STALACTITE CAVES ARE TO BE SEEN ON ONLY A CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR ONLY,ITS SO DIFFICULT TO SEE THEN.

   THE SMALL RIVER STARTING FROM THE CLEFT IS KNOWN AS THE SEILLE,ITS VERY LOVELY TO SEE THE DEPTH OF THAT.NARROW VALLEY OF THE EMERALD GREEN SOUNDS ARE SEEMED TO BE MUSICALLY.THE MOUNTAIN GORGE OPENS BY LITTLE BY LITTLE AS WE PROCEED,SHOWING A SILKY PASTURES LITTLE HERDSMEN AND HERDSWOMEN ARE HOLDING THEIR COWS,GOATS,BLACK AND WHITE,BROWSE ALONG WITH THE STEEP ROCKS .THE VALLEY WINDS FOR HALF A MILE TO  THE STRAGLING VILLAGE OF BAUME.NOTHING IS FINE IN THE WAY OF SCENERY IS TO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE JURA.

THE BUIDINGS OF THIS ONCE IMPORTANT ABBEY OF BAUME ARE NOW GOT IN TO THE FARM HOUSE,BUT ENOUGH REMAINS TO BESPEAK THE FORMER MAGNIFICENCE OF THIS MOST ARISTOCRATIC MONASTERY, [FOOTNOTE: CONSULT ROUSSEL'S "DICTIONNAIRE DE FRANCHE-COMTE" ON THE SUBJECT. IT IS VERY VOLUMINOUS, BUT LIKE ANY OTHER WORK ON FRANCHE-COMTE, MAY BE CONSULTED IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF LONS-LE-SAUNIER WITHOUT TROUBLE OR FORMALITY.] TO WHICH NONE COULD BE ADMITTED WITHOUT FURNISHING PROOF OF PURE DEGREE OF NOBILITY ON BOTH THE PATERNAL AND MATERNAL SIDES. ADJOINING THE ABBEY IS THE CHURCH, WHICH POSSESSES AT LEAST ONE CHEF-D'OEUVRE IN ITS RETABLE. 
THIS ALTAR-PIECE OF WOOD APPEARS TO BELONG TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY, AND IS IN THE FORM OF A TRIPTYCH, THE WINGS BEING ENRICHED WITHIN AND WITHOUT BY PAINTINGS IN EXCELLENT PRESERVATION. THE INTERIOR IS DIVIDED INTO SIX COMPARTMENTS, IN WHICH ARE REPRESENTED THE VARIOUS SCENES OF THE LIFE AND PASSION OF CHRIST. THE VARIOUS FIGURES ARE FINELY SCULPTURED, AND COVERED WITH GOLD. OTHER PAINTINGS BY THE SAME ARTIST DECORATE THE WALLS OF THE CHURCH. 
ONE TOMB, THAT OF AN ABBE OF BAUME, IS VERY BEAUTIFUL, BEING ORNAMENTED WITH SEVEN SMALL STATUETTES OF WEEPING MONKS, WHO OCCUPY LITTLE GOTHIC NICHES. THE EXPRESSION AND ATTITUDE OF THESE FIGURES ARE TOUCHING IN THE EXTREME. ALL THESE MONUMENTS ARE HIGHLY INTERESTING, AND WORTHY OF BEING STUDIED IN DETAIL. THE CHURCH IS DISFIGURED BY NOT A FEW MODERN FRIVOLITIES AND VULGARITIES. 
MANY OBJECTS ILLUSTRATING THE PRE-HISTORIC AND MOST ANCIENT PERIODS OF FRENCH HISTORY HAVE BEEN FOUND AT BAUME; BRONZE WEAPONS AND ORNAMENTS, GALLO-ROMAN RELICS, TOMBS, STATUETTES, &C., WHILST A ROMAN CAMP, THE LARGEST IN THE JURA, HAS BEEN TRACED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKS. THIS WAS DESTINED TO PROTECT THE ROAD FROM LYONS TO THE RHINE, AND OCCUPIED THE HEIGHT KNOWN AS MOUNT SERMUS. 
BAUME SHARED THE FATE OF MOST OTHER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE ICONOCLASTIC PERIOD OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, AND WHEN WE CONSIDER WHAT THE PITCH OF POPULAR FURY WAS THEN, WE ARE RATHER TEMPTED TO WONDER THAT ANYTHING WAS LEFT, RATHER THAN THAT SO MANY TREASURES WERE DESTROYED.
