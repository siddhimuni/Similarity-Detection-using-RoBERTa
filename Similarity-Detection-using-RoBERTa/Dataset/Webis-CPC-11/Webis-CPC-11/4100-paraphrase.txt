At the casualty clearing station, which was located in Gomery, Dr. Sedillot was in charge of caring for numerous wounded German soldiers. The station passed inspection by a German officer accompanised by twenty five of his men. The majority of the party retired, however, an N.C.O. and a party of soldiers remained in the street outside.  They became rambunctious and began shouting, "It is war to the death," while making signs of cutting throats.  The soldiers rushed into the station, shot down Dr. Sedillot (who was fortunate enough to survive), and set fire to the place.  The wounded, many of whom had underwent amputations that very morning, leapt out of the first story windows to escape the flames.  They were picked up by executioners who gathered the wounded soldiers and mercilessly shot them.  Among the one hundred to one hudred twenty five murdered were Lieutenant Jeannin and Dr. Charette.

Sadly, these deaths seem more humane when compared to the torturous starvation suffered by over two hundred Frenchmen.  These men, along with Dr. Bender, were brought to the Stenay barracks.  A large number of these men were in terrible conditions, having been left out unattended in the battle field for five days.  Dr. Bender begged the German soldiers for help in transporting the wounded to a hospital.  The Boches refused to offer any aid to the suffering men.  Dr. Bender, along with two male nurses, tended to the massive number of wounded men themselves.  For several days, they received no food from the Boches.  Sadly, most of these men died of neglect.

Boche doctors have a notorious history of performing horrible deeds.  The most hideous hero of this sad bunch comes from a tale told by Dr. Bender.
