Whilst SCHWANN appropriated an hour of the Sitting, and
SEYMOUR-KEAY exceeded that time, twenty-five minutes served Mr. G. for a speech delivered without
note, apparently without preparation, and which left nothing more to be said.

"Upon my word, Sir," I said, a little out of breath trying to keep pace with him running up
the Duke of YORK'S steps going home to dinner, "you grow younger every year, and, if I may
say so, mellower."

"You certainly may say so, TOBY, if you like," he smilingly replied, "but the calendar says
otherwise."

"What," I asked--

  "What has the calendar to do
    With Mr. G.? What Time's fruitless tooth
  With gay immortals such as you,
    Whose years but emphasise your youth?"

"Ah, I know that--with a slight difference. LOWELL wrote it to WENDEL HOLMES on his seventy-fifth
birthday. I knew HOLMES too; he used to crow over me because he was just four months older,
and yet, as he said, whilst I pleaded age as a reason why I could not visit the United States,
he crossed the Atlantic at seventy-seven. Perhaps when I've got this Home-Rule question off
my hands, I may find time to go to the United States."

"Yes," I said, "you'll be another year younger then, and more at leisure."

Business done.--Indian Council Bill read Second Time.

Tuesday.--Some sensation created at Morning Sitting by discovery of CUNINGHAME GRAHAM addressing
House from Conservative Benches. There was a well-known Member of the Parliament of 1874 who
hit upon new device for, as he reckoned, doubling his chance of catching SPEAKER'S eye.
