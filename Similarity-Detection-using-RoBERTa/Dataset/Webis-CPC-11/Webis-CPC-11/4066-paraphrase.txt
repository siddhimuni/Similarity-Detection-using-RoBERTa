"If Lucy wants to drop the correspondence, I am sure you are not obliged to keep," says Kate. 

So the letter never written, and the friends, and although I am a great admirer of the virtue of constancy, even argue that there are cases where it is a mere mockery, the empty shell that we had better throw away when the core is gone. 

But the friendships of girls are often made by proximity, neighborhood, adjacent houses, and regular meetings in the regular round of life. 

The average girl, especially if they live in the country, usually has a very large circle of acquaintances to choose their friends (and without prejudice to what is said about the adequacy of family affections, I think a "special friend" is almost a necessity of nature girl, and need not and should not interfere with family ties and interests). Even if the list of visiting her mother is long, each household shall not include a girl her age with whom to be intimate, and many of them live at a distance to make frequent sexual relations out of the question. 

Yes, the circle is reduced to about five or six years, maybe three or four girls, and, of course, see most of the living one nearest you. 

You are in your walk, if you live in the country, continually "drop in" to tea and tennis in each other's houses. If you live in a village, he falls just before or just after his round of visits to more formal, and get to know the daily life of others, the interests of every day, the pleasures and difficulties in great depth, and this crossing of the day-to-day existence forms many friendships. 

You get used to each other; trivial incidents of time, perhaps, his buddy, which have a transitory interest for one, the interests of others, no less. Your friend knows exactly what work he is doing just that book you are reading. You have a lot of time to talk, and little by little everyone knows almost everything about the life of another, lives are short, and in this period neither deep nor complicated.
