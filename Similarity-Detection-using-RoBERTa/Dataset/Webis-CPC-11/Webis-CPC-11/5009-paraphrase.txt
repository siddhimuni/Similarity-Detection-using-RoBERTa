Professional assistance should always be sought when digging trenches to provide extra moisture and irrigation for your orchard.

Remember that, should the roots be accidentally damaged when you are digging, the tree will most likely fail to thrive. Also, in summer, apple and pear tree often put out suckers, which are not only a great nuisance to the gardener, but, should these be left, can eventually do great damage to the orchard. 

Cherry and plum trees, kept free of suckers, will thrive and bear fruit for upwards of twenty years.

Situation: grass:The presence of grass will also help keep lock moisture to the the roots, but remove any mosses growing close to the tree roots, keep them open to as much sun and air as possible.

If you find the ground becoming slightly waterlogged, dont worry, trees love the earth around their roots to be as moist as possible, depending on the soil. Stiff clay will repel much of the water, whilst sandy soil may not retain enough to provide nourishment, therefore a good mulch of manure is recommended.

Situation: Poor soil:the ground should preferably be leveled, as uneven ground will not retain water and minerals as well
 as flat. The area of the orchard be a fairly sheltered one, but open to sun and rain. Weeds such as dock can be well dug in to provide extra  compost and should not spring up again. Once the trees are settled into the soil, resist all temptation to move them, as this may well cause irreversible damage their roots. The site should not only be leveled, but cleared of weeds, and old masonry, hedges and other impediments to sun and air.

The siting of your orchard.

Situation: Flood Plain.


I find that any field with good soil has the potential to become a good situation for an orchard.
