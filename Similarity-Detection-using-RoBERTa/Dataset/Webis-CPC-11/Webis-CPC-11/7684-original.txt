Of an intriguing nobleman like the Duke of Norfolk, he is as prompt to
speak as of the harp itself: "He was one of those politicians who are never contented; who
plot and counterplot incessantly; who are always running their heads fearlessly, to be sure,
but indiscreetly, into danger of decapitation." This fine analytic power appears throughout
the book. Describing the enthusiasm of the Londoners for Henry of Bolingbroke, and their coldness
towards the captive King Richard, the historian acutely observes: "Ever thus, from the beginning
of the world, have those been insulted who have fallen from a high estate. The multitude follows
successful usurpation, but never offers a shield to fallen dignity."
