He did not feel the loss of intellectual stature much. This was partly a result of the ingenuity with which he explained how he made the mistake. Even though there was loss in intellectual prestige, there was also an increased sense of intellectual comradeship for him. But this is a small and unimportant digression.
Some masters are for intellectual infallibility. These political discussions unnerved them. They felt that their credentials as schoolmasters were being found inadequate. The masters accused the boys of priggery. It was a false charge, the boys were enthusiasts, and enthusiasm is as much a form of self-forgetfulness as priggery is a form of self-consciousness. Still priggery was the word they used for the boys. "Priggery" was then added to the charge of "pacifism."

On these lines the opposition developed and ultimately was triumphant. Many suggested that the school would be empty in a couple of years if political education continued. Yet it would seem, that the critics were counting on their false idea of the parent and believing what they wished to believe. The only conclusion you can draw from the statistics of entrance is that political education either had no effect at all or that it slightly increased the commercial well-being of the school. It was not on these grounds that political education was doomed. As we stated at the beginning of the chapter, the material of our experiments was solely the boys. We had made a quick cut. We had made no efforts to conversion our colleagues. We trusted the results to do the conversion work for us. But, as the preceding narrative will have shown, our success led to their irritation.  This was when success became labelled "pacifism" and "priggery."
