Hobbes claims that the only basis of right and wrong is the civil law. Rousseau
says all the morality of actions is in the judgement we ourselves form of them. Shaftsbury
says, all the obligations to be virtuous arise from the advantages of virtue, and the disadvantages
of vice. Have such moral principles ever reformed the world? Do they reform their advocates?
Did you ever know a man to reform after he became an advocate of such principles? Did you ever
know a man to reform after understanding and abandoning the Christian religion? If any such
ever reformed their lives after setting themselves on Pagan ground, by opposing Christianity,
I have yet to learn the fact. It is the morality of a wicked world that simply asks for the
profitable, and not the right; which inquires not for duty, but for self-interest—for the opinions
of men; it is a body without a spirit—a whitewashed sepulchre—splendid only in sepulchral greatness.

Morality rests not upon principles that clothe themselves in various garbs to please the different
fancies of the different ages, consulting simply the spirit of the times. Such morality is
one thing to-day and quite another to-morrow—it is variable as the seasons. It adapts itself
to the occasion—to the hour. It is very pliant—it has no conscience, but is always popularity-seeking.
The morality of the Christian religion is very different. In the New Testament we find a morality
as pure, lofty and unchanging as its divine author; it purifies and regulates the inner man—“make
the tree good and the fruit will be good.” The Bible settles the great question of duty. It
teaches us that to do right is to do that which is right in itself, from pure motives and with
a right spirit. These two things God hath joined together, viz: the right deed from right motives,
and the right spirit. A man’s conscience may be satisfied without the right motives and without
the right spirit, but that is not enough.
