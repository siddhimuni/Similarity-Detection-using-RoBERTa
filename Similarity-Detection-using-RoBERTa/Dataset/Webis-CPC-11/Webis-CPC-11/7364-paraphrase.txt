And also hauing finished generally there, he went straight into Spaine, and so his or her iournie into Britaine was defer till the future yeare, that can be, the 726 following a building of Paris, which fell ahead of the birth of our sauiour 25, about which time frame Augustus eftsoons meant thirdly time to haue made a voiage straight into Britaine, because they can not agr√©e vpon couenants.
