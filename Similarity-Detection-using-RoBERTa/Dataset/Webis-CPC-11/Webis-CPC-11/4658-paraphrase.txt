The purpose of this last notice is to prove Mr. Peacock wasn't quite on the mark in his chronology, or his overview of Shelley and Harriet's split. Alluding either to the discretion that thwarted Shelley from gaining the trust of Mr. Peacock, or to his sadness of the fate of Harriet, the author refers to "the proof that is evident in a series of letters written by Shelley at the instant of trust with someone, and in the presence of his family". 
"Nothing more fluent or charming ever flowed from his pen; and the grant undeniable proof of the grief and pain of that terrible moment that they tell of. Yet, self reproach showed no element of his sorrow, which, within he could say "____ ____", mentioning the names of two unbiased businessmen, "everyone does me justice, bears testament to the liberality of my conduct toward her."

In the "Memorials" and the "Relics" there is no difference to the circumstances that happened just before Harriet's suicide; but it appeared to me very likely that the story should have been brought out better, and I can explain why I feel this way. The letters in question took place in the middle of December, 1816. Shelley was married to Mary a while later; and in the most emphatic way, he kept the conversation of his host secret, similar to the way my father spoke of Mary. My own memory goes back to that time, and I have already questioned the state of Shelley's mind. He was trying to get his children back, and thought that in the event of his marriage, he would be able so.

Let me pause for a moment, as it contains two facts of similar interest. On one hand, it shows a great friendship and confidence shared between my father and Mary. On the other hand, it also expresses the sensitivity, quick tempered, and outspoken ways of both.
