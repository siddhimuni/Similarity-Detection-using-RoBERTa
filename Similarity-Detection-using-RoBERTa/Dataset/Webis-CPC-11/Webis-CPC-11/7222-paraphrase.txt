But if the accent on the last syllable, although it is strictly a right to put it to English, it's not worth it, for fear of hearing talk about a strange sound, rather than attend the service. Be safer to accentuate the penultimate dissyllables, and the second to last in trisyllables, which in Greek is acutitones actually pronounce, like all clergymen used to decide, until a pedantic and ignorant practice arose from the extension, or accentuate each syllable in the penultimate, which had or should have a certain amount of time in Greek. 
Hence the relatively new practice of pronouncing [Greek: Sabaoth], [Greek: Zaboulôn], [Greek: sabachthani], [Greek: Akeldama], with a strong accent on the penultimate, and that the old way of accentuating the penultimate ago without looking, and is an approach much closer to the real pronunciation. 

There is a curious contradiction in the usual way of reading in English, [Greek: Samarei] and [Greek: Kaisareia]. Samar [= i] is definitely a Greek word, but nevertheless, this word, it tends to accentuate the penultimate. Cesar [) e] a is definitely a Græcised Latin word, and yet it is usual to read this with an accent on the penultimate. Never saw any of you reading Sabaoth, Zebulun, and sabachthani, read or Samaria or Caesarea. The accents of the Hebrew Greek words always agree, as Hebraists know, with the tonic accent in that language. 

ECH As a contribution to the object of desire to resolve the pronunciation of the words mentioned, the following representation of their pronunciation in the original offered. 

Vowels are read as in Italian and English day, and hh as ch in German: 

Hebrew. 

Sabaoth = ts [) i]-v [= a ]-['= o] th. 

Hebrew. [The] Moriah = [[h)] mm] [= o]-r [= i], and [= a] h. Syriac. Aceldama = hh [) i], [k ') a] ld [) i] m [= a]. 

Syro-Chaldean. Eli Eli lamma sabachthani [= e] l [= i] [= e] l [= i] [l) a] mm [= a] s [) a]-b [') a] hh-t [) e] n ['= i], as in Matthew, or [) E] l [= o]-h [= i], as in Mark.
