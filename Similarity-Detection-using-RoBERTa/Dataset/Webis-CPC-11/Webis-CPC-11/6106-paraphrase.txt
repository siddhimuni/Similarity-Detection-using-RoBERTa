"I thought I'd pay you a visit," he said.

Armidy was glad he came and welcomed him into her home. He followed her into the kitchen. Taking a look around, he couldn't remember the room from what it used to be.  

Armidy sadly re-assured him that it was the same kitchen.

"Everything seems to be a mess. What happened here?"

"We've tried to get things sorted out. Now, the outside is a wreck because of Lucas."

"Don't worry. You know if I could help you, I would."

"What has been going on since you've left?"

"Well, I was running a distillery and selling oils and essences. However, I eventually had to sel it in order to come here."

"Oh Theodore, I wish you had never left. You should have stayed with us. I've missed and worried about you."

Armidy abruptly ran outside, as Lucas was returning home, "Lucas! Your brother is here!" Lucas was quite happy with the news, meeting Theodore with a handshake.

"How's it going Lucas?"

Theodore was such a breath of fresh air to all. He never took sides. He was always helpful. If he did for one, he did for the other. No questions asked. At the same time, he was keen on his surroundings, very careful not to rock the boat.

Armidy and Lucas were grateful to have Theodore in their home. They always loved him being in his presence. It brought them such joy.

Theodore, now with Armidy and Lucas, worked hard to help them. He used what was not wanted from their garden and return to his skill of distilling essences, such as peppermint and wintergreen. He created a new business and used the money he earned to help Armidy and Lucas in their home, and once in a while present Armidy with a lovely gift, be it a handkerchief or a gown. Anything to make her smile.
