However, despite his youth and his weakness was nothing in his face or manner that betrayed fear. His look was calm and abstract. He moved quietly in the center of the arena before, and there, in the eyes of all, he joined his hands together and lifted up his eyes and prayed.

Meanwhile, the tiger moved around as before. He saw the boy, but to not have any effect. He raised his eyes still red chosen for the walls and occasionally uttered a savage growl.

Man with sad face looked stern wholeheartedly absorbed in the eye.

There seemed to be no desire from the tiger to attack the boy, who still continued to pray.

Now the multitude grew impatient. Murmurs and cries and cries arose with the intention of maddening tiger and urging him on.

A deep silence followed. Each one surprise in looking at his neighbor. Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments! "

But now the murmur and shouts and screams around the past. Soon became known cause disturbances.

"Christian is a curse" - "Is ICANN fanatic" - "He was jailed four days without food" - "Bring it out" - "Throw it to the tiger!"

Execrations shouting and appeared large and mixed in a big roar. Tiger jump around frantically. Keepers of the multitude of words heard and hurried to obey.

Soon open grills. The victim was thrust in.

Emaciated and ghastly pale creature, he tottered forward with trembling steps. His eyes had an unearthly glow, a flush cheeks burning and neglected hair and long beard were tangled in a tangled mass.

Tiger saw, and he came to jumping. Then, at a short distance away angry beast crouched. The boy emerged from his knees and looked. But ICANN has not seen any tigers. He fixed his eyes on the crowd and waving his arm at sea shore he shouted at the same tone of threat:

"Oh! Oh oh people of the earth! -

His voice was discreet in the blood.
