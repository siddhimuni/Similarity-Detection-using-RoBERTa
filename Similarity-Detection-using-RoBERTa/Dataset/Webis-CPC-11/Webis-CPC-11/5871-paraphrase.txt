I see before me, this glorious palace as though i had left it only yesterday. Here i had made acquaintanceship with my closest friends when I was just seventeen. I see the outstanding courtyard, the stately porticos, the saloons adorned with columns, statues and bas-reliefs; and, among these lovely and fabulous objects, vestiges of the bygone grandness of the ducal residence, the long lines of bedsteads and school-benches, the hanging rows of uniforms, dirks and rifles. Five hundred youths are befuddled about those courts and corridors and staircases; a muted whispers of voices, broken by joyful shouts and sonorous laughter, reverberates through the most distant recesses of the huge edifice. What animation! What life! What varieties of type, of speech and gesture! Energetic Youths of gymnastic  build, with great moustaches and booming voices; youths as lean and sweet as girls; the dusky skin and coal-black eyes of Sicily; the fair-haired, blue-eyed faces of the north; the excited gesticulation of Naples, the silvery Tuscan intonation, the rattling Venetian chatter, a hundred groups, a hundred dialects; on this side, songs and noisy talk, on that side running, jumping, and hand-clapping; men of every class, sons of dukes, senators, generals, shopkeepers, government employees; a strange assemblage, suggesting the university, the monastery, and the barracks: with talk of women, war, novels, the orders of the day; a life teeming with feminine meannesses and virile ambitions; a life of mortal ennui and frantic gayety, a medley of sentiments, actions, and incidents, absurd, tragic, or delightful, from which the pen of a great humorist could extract the materials for a masterpiece.

Such was the military college of Modena in the year 1865.

III.

I cannot recollect in my mind the two years that I spent there without being beset by a throng of memories from which I can free myself only by passing them all in review, one after another, like pictures in a magic-lantern; now giggling, now sighing, now shaking my head, but feeling all the while that each episode is close to my heart and will cannot be forgotten in this lifetime.

How well I remember the first tragedy of my military life, a blow which was destined to come on my way a few days after I had entered college all aglow with the poetry of war. It was the morning on which caps were distributed. Each newcomer of military found one that suited him, but all were too tiny for me, and the captain turned upon me angrily.

"Are you aware of the fact that the commissary stores will have to be reopened just for you?" And I remember hearing him murmur after a pause, "What are you going to do with a head like that?"

Great God, what I went through at that moment! What--be a soldier? I questioned myself. Never! Better beg my bread n butter in the streets--better die and finish with it!

Then I can recall an officer, an aged soldier, ill-humored but kindly, who had a way of smiling whenever he looked at me. How that smile used to exasperate me! I had made up my mind to demand an explanation, to let him know that I didn't propose to be any man's butt, when one evening he called me to him, and having given me to understand that he had heard something about me and that he wanted to know if it were really correct(I was to speak frankly, for it would do me no harm), he finally, with many coughs and smiles and furtive glances, whispered in my ear: "Is it true that you write poetry?"

I recall, too, the insuperable difficulty of accomplishing the manual tasks imposed upon me, especially that of sewing on my buttons--how every few seconds the needle would slip through my fingers, till the thread was tangled up in a veritable spider's web, while the button hung as loose as ever, to the derision of my companions and the disgust of the drill-sergeant, whose contemptuous--"You may be a great hand at rhyming, but when it comes to sewing on buttons you're a hundred years behind the times," seemed to exile me to the depths of the eighteenth century.

The scene changes, and I see myself locked in a narrow cell on the fifth floor, a jug of water at my side, a piece of black bread in my hand, with unkempt hair and unshorn chin, and the image of Silvio Pellico before me; condemned to ten days' imprisonment for having made an address of thanks to the professor of chemistry on the occasion of his closing lecture, thereby committing an infraction of article number so- and-so of the regulation forbidding any cadet to speak in public in the name of his companions. And to this day I can hear the Major saying: "Take my advice and never let your imagination run away with you;" citing the example of his old school-fellow, the poet Regaldi, who had got into just such a scrape, and concluding with the warning that "poetry always made men make asses of themselves."
