If the ducks win there will be fine climate through the winter; if the ptarmigans, bad. This after summer carnival might, of course, with identical magical intent be presented in the jump, but likely after summer is selected because, with the fear of the Arctic ice and snowfall upon them, the worry of winter is more powerful than the wish of spring.

The strong strong feeling in the direction of the climate, which breaks out into these magical agones, or "contests," is not very so straightforward to realize. The climate to us now-a-days for the most part damps a day's pleasuring or raises the cost of crop and vegetables. But our major provision arrive to us from other countries and other withstands, and we find it hard to believe us back into the state when a awful collection intended starvation. The intensely functional mind-set of man in the direction of the times of the year, the way that numerous of these magical spectacular observance increased directly out of the strong feeling in the direction of the food-supply, would possibly not ever have been completely recognized but for the study of the food-producing observance of the Central Australians.

The Central Australian jump is not the move from winter to summer, from freezing to heat, but from a long, arid, and barren time of the year to a time of the year short and often irregular in recurrence of torrential rainfall and rapid fertility. The dry steppes of Central Australia are the view of a marvellous transformation. In the dry time of the year all is warm and desolate, the ground has only patches of wiry scrub, with an occasional parched acacia tree, all is pebbles and sand; there is no signal of animal life save for the 1000 ant-hills. Then abruptly the rainy time of the year groups in. Torrents load up the streams, and the sandy simple is a sheet of water. Almost as abruptly the rainfall ceases, the creeks dry up, imbibed in by the parched ground, and as though literally by illusion a luxuriant vegetation bursts forward, the wasteland blossoms as a rose. Insects, lizards, frogs, birds, chirp, frisk and chatter. No vegetation or animal can reside except it reside quickly. The labour for reality is enthusiastic and short.

The savage utters his will to reside, his strong yearn for food; but it should be documented, it is yearn and will and yearning, not certainty and approval that he utters. In this esteem it is intriguing to note that his rites and observance, when periodic, are of equitably long periods. Winter and summer are not the only natural periodic cycles; there is the cycle of day and evening, and yet amidst primitive peoples but little ceremonial hubs around day and night. The cause is simple. The cycle of day and evening is so short, it recurs so often, that man routinely counted upon it and had no origin to be anxious. The emotional stress essential to ceremonial was absent. A couple of peoples, for demonstration the Egyptians, have skilful every day incantations to convey back the sun. Probably they had at the start sensed a genuine stress of disquiet, and then--being a persons hidebound by custom--had gone on from meagre conservatism. Where the sun comes back at a longer gap, and is even, as amidst the Esquimaux, concealed for the long space of six months, ceremonial inescapably arises. They play at cat's-cradle to apprehend the ball of the sun lest it should go under and be lost for ever.
