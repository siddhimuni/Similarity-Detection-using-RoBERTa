Prof. S. F. Baird:

Sir: i have just been in the fish market and a crew were bringing in their fish from one of the "traps." a noticeable and peculiar feature of the fishery this year is the great numbers of young salmon caught, especially at the vineyard, although some few are caught daily at sconticut neck (mouth of our river). There are apparently two different ages of them. Mostly about 2 pounds in weight (about as long as a large mackerel) and about one-half as many weighing from 6 to 8 pounds; occasionally one larger. One last week weighed 33 pounds and one 18 pounds. The fishermen think they are the young of those with which some of our rivers have been stocked, as nothing of the kind has occurred in past years at all like this.

Prof spencer f. Baird:

Sir: i received yours. I have examined carefully since your letter, but no salmon have been taken. The run was about the two first weeks in may and a few the last of april. Mr. Bassett had about 30 to 35 from the trap at menimpsha, and 10 or 12 from sconticut neck, the mouth of our river. Mr. Bartlett, at his fish market, had about one dozen; 12 from the traps near the mouth of slocum's river, six miles west of here, and i have heard of two taken at mouth of westport river.

As to the particular species, i do not get any reliable information, as so few of our fishermen know anything about salmon, and in fact the men from the traps on sconticut neck did not know what the fish were.
