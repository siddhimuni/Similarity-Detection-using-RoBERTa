Protestant mission sites in the Ornge free Sites is confiscated is one of the instances and another was best described as a raid carried out about forty years ago by Transvaal Boers on the inoffensive Bechuana tribe, whose chief and many people accepted Christian faith through the teaching of Moffat, David and Livingstone and evangelists. The reason for that raid was report that Bechuana chief had exchanged some 400 guns for traders to fight the Boers.An ultimatum was sent by Boers to surrender all these weapons. In spite of protestation of the chief and his people that only eight guns had been barted for hunting, which latter on found to be true, a commondo under commandant Paul Krugner, now president Krugner was sent. In the operation, many of the natives were slain, their villages were burnt, their cattle seized and great number of tribes were taken captive for use as servants among the Boer farmers in the Transvaal. This raid was followed by the total destruction of Moffat"s mission station-Church, school buildings and industrial shops. After being looted these were consigned to flames so also the missionary dwellings and amonst them was that of david Livingstone, with his furniture, books, and belongings.There are enough records to ahow that besides Bechuana nation, that barbarous and idolatrous peoples are ameanable to christanity voluntarily. Operation of civilised and liberal governmental authority resulted in immense aid  fro moral and economic advancement.This resulted in represssing slavery and proprietary rights and justice were equally afforded to black and white and Gospel might have free course without constraint and without inducements of material advantages.
It happened that such conditions were on the eve of eventuating for the rescue and freedom of darkest africa.This what all the devoted servants including Moffat,Livingstone, Colliard had prayed for all their lives,what has been and it is still is the burden of the prayers(Without doubt inspired) of millions of Christians.
