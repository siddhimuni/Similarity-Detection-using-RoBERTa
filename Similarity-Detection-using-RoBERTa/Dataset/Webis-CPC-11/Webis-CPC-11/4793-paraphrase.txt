Miss Roosevelt visit to Cuba is said to have been more or less a failure in terms of speaking Latin. Miss Roosevelt did not "get" the Cuban element. It is Anglo-Saxon compromise and malleability that would not endear her to the children of another race. Cuban women excel in mannerism and charm in their eyes Miss Roosevelt is unpolished and uncut. You might like it better than it is, but it is safe to say that had it, but added a few years experience would have been a more merciful to her trip. Miss Roosevelt Scovel was recently at Sherry's mass. She wore an exquisite white dress, but is not itself a pretty girl, although her grace her part mediocrity rises somewhat.

It is the province of brides to be as ornate as circumstances permit. Then why not car about Mrs. Depew Washington a miserable car that most people would refuse to be seen? It is humility?

How often we read of the ten thousand dollars a month, which will lead our ambassador at Brook House! In justice to Mr Reid he must be held because he is simplicity itself, and nobody is assumed that either he or Mrs. Reid attended the publication of these details. He showed wisdom in preference to their own quarters proffered royal family over who would be assigned. He is elected for fitness, but he was the veriest clod dignity of his position would still carry with him sufficient respect. Our desire to beautify its importance is absurd and the everyday hysteria is calculated to put a dignified gentleman in a ridiculous light.
