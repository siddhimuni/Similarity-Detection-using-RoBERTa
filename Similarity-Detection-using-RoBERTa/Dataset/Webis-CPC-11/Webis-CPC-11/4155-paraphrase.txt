The great poets like Hor, Homer, Francis and others narrate the heroic events in the life of the kings of the past, the justice they provided, the evidence they adduced and the punishments they ordered, the war they participated etc. are unveiled here.
There are certain methods and cnventional laws of courtesy in life which every one is to be observed in life.  But merely because of the avoid of such laws will not amount to the commission of a crime or infringe of a duty.  The passed by the States are based on the prevailing customs which has a moralcommmandment and all people in the society to follow such laws.  If any one is accused for violation of the aforesaid laws, he cannot be treated as a notorious criminal or as a person betraying of the government or who acts against politeness or against the custom of High Court.
It is seemed that only the periodical essayists and such other writers are attached to these laws.  Homer adopted a modern phrase in the peoms narrating heroic events.  Whoever pass beyond the limit will be treated as accused for the violation of established customs and regulations.  So it is an advice to those who involved like Spectator, Guardian and others, against the breach of conventional laws.
Hence the periodical writers has to observe things in a creative way.  They have to watch amd study things in detail and learn from the contribution of established writers.  They must use their potentiality;  This what established by Spectaro, hakespeare, Milton and others in their contribution to the society and which were widely accepted.
